## Project Vision

To develop an application for mobile devices in order to reduce cost and time incurred in
school and college level studies through automation, artificial intelligence, and information management.


## Problem Statement

The current education system in Pakistan relies on hard-copied books for studying, and notebooks for writing down. All the other routine tasks in most of the schools and colleges of Pakistan are paper-based. Although these traditional methods for academic management have long been in practice, technology advancements call for a digital and smart system to manage academic tasks.
Moreover, Research shows that heavy backpacks (10-20% of body weight) cause back, neck, and shoulder pain. On average, the backpack of high school and college students (Larissa, 2020). Another major drawback of heavy backpacks is that they affect the height of children. When you add an extremely heavy backpack, five days a week for over a decade, we&#39;re basically crushing those water-filled gaps, compressing the spine with all the extra weight. A backpack accelerates the rate at which we lose water in the lumbar disks, causing us to shrink a little bit more quickly.

## Goals and Objectives

- Digitize the current education system
- Make exam papers with less effort and more accuracy
- Normalize smart learning

## Project Scope

There will be three apps i.e Student, faculty and admin. 
When students open the app they will be able to login to the system. After logging in to the system, a menu bar will pop up at the top left corner of the screen. That menu will provide them with different options. If they click on the profile option they will be able to view and edit their profile. Result option will allow them to view their results. Similarly, the attendance option will allow them to view their attendance and the fee option displays their fee. Not just this, the student app will allow them to chat with their teachers in case of any problem and can upload the tasks provided to them. 
Teachers app will also have a login screen after which a menu will be displayed through the menu bar. This menu bar will contain different options like upload result which will provide the functionality to upload the result of the students after papers are automatically checked by the system. Moreover, not just automatic paper checking will be provided, but automatic paper generation will also be provided for the ease of teachers. Teachers will also be able to record their screens. 
Admin will also be provided some useful functionalities like they will be able to manage the fees of students. Moreover, enrolling students will also be the responsibility of an admin. Teachers and students will not be able to sign in on their own,  admin will be responsible for this too.
