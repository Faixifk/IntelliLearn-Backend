it works is science The branch of science which deals with the composition structur e properties and reactions of matter is called chemistry It deals with every aspect of our life The development of science and technology has provided us a lot of facilities in daily life Imagine the role and importance of petrochemical products medicines and drugs soap detergents paper plastics paints and pigments insecticides pesticides which all are fruit of the efforts of chemists The development of chemical industry has also generated toxic wastes contaminated water and polluted air around us On the other hand chemistry also provides knowledge and techniques to improve our health and environment and to explore and to conserve the natural resources In this chapter we will study about different branches of chemistry basic definitions and concepts of chemistry11 OF It is a fact that we live in the world of chemicals We all depend upon different living organisms which require water oxygen or carbon dioxide for their survival Today chemistry has a wide scope in all aspects of life and is serving the humanity day and night Chemistry is divided into following main branches physical chemistry organic chemistry inorganic chemistry biochemistry industrial chemistry nuclear chemistry environmental chemistry and analytical chemistry111 Physical Chemistry Physical Chemistry is defined as the branch of chemistry that deals with the relationship between the composition and physical properties of matter along with the changes in them The properties such as structure of atoms or formation of molecules behavior of gases liquids and solids and the study of the effect of temperature or radiation on matter are studied under this branch112 Organic Chemistry Organic Chemistry is the study of covalent compounds of carbon and hydrogen hydrocarbons and their derivatives Organic compounds occur naturally and are also synthesized in the laboratories Organic chemists determine the structure and properties of these naturally occurring as well as synthesized compounds Scope of this branch covers petroleum petrochemicals and pharmaceutical industries113 Inorganic Chemistry Inorganic chemistry deals with the study of all elements and their compounds except those of compounds of carbon and hydrogen hydrocarbons and their derivatives It has applications in every aspect of the chemical industry such as glass cement ceramics and metallurgy extraction of metals from ores2114 Biochemistry It is the branch of chemistry in which we study the structure composition and chemical reactions of substances found in living organisms It covers all chemical processes taking place in living organisms such as synthesis and metabolism of biomolecules like carbohydrates proteins and fats Biochemistry emerged as a separate discipline when scientists began to study how living things obtain energy from food or how the fundamental biological changes occur during a disease Examples of applications of biochemistry are in the fields of medicine food science and agriculture etc115 Industrial Chemistry The branch of chemistry that deals with the manufacturing of chemical compounds on commercial scale is called industrial chemistry It deals with the manufacturing of basic chemicals such as oxygen chlorine ammonia caustic soda nitric acid and sulphuric acid These chemicals provide the raw materials for many other industries such as fertilizers soap textiles agricultural products paints and paper etc116 Nuclear Chemistry Nuclear Chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the radioactivity nuclear processes and properties The main concern of this branch is with the atomic energy and its uses in daily life It also includes the study of the chemical effects resulting from the absorption of radiation within animals plants and other materials It has vast applications in medical treatment radiotherapy preservation of food and generation of electrical power through nuclear reactors etc117 Environmental Chemistry It is the branch of chemistry in which we study about components of the environment and the effects of human activities on the environment Environmental chemistry is related to other branches like biology geology ecology soil and water The knowledge of chemical processes taking place in environment is necessary for its improvement and protection against pollution118 Analytical Chemistry Analytical chemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with separation and analysis of a sample to identify its components The separation is carried out prior to qualitative and quantitative analysis Qualitative analysis provides the identity of a substance composition of chemical species On the other hand quantitative analysis determines the amount of each component present in the sample Hence in this branch different techniques and instruments used for analysis are studied The scope of this branch covers food water environmental and clinical analysis3 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IXTest yourself1112 Matter is simply defined as anything that has mass and occupies space Our bodies as well as all the things around us are examples of matter In chemistry we study all types of matters that can exist in any of three physical states solid liquid or gas A piece of matter in pure form is termed as a substance Every substance has a fixed composition and specific properties or characteristics Whereas impure matter is called a mixture which can be homogeneous or heterogeneous in its composition We know that every substance has physical as well as chemical properties The properties those are associated with the physical state of the substance are called physical properties like colour smell taste hardness shape of crystal solubility melting or boiling points etc For example when ice is heated it melts to form water When water is further heated it boils to give steam In this entire process only the physical states of water change whereas its chemical composition remains the same The chemical properties depend upon the composition of the substance When a substance undergoes a chemical change its composition changes and a new substances are formed For example decomposition of water is a chemical change as it produces hydrogen and oxygen gases All materials are either a substance or a mixture

Elements In the early ages only nine elements carbon gold silver tin mercury lead copper iron and sulphur were known At that time it was considered that elements were the substances that could not be broken down into simpler units by ordinary chemical processes Until the end of nineteenth century sixtythree elements had been discovered Now 118 elements have been discovered out of which 92 are naturally occurring elements Modern definition of element is that it is a substance made up of same type of atoms having same atomic number and cannot be decomposed into simple substances by ordinary chemical means It means that each element is made up of unique type of atoms that have very specific properties Elements occur in nature in free or combined form All the naturally occurring elements found in the world have different percentages in the earths crust oceans and atmosphere Table 11 shows natural occurrence in percentage by weight of some major elements around us It shows concentrations of these major elements found in the three main systems of our environmentTable 11 Natural Occurrences by Weight  of Some Major Elements Elements may be solids liquids or gases Majority of the elements exist as solids eg sodium copper zinc gold etc There are very few elements which occur in liquid state eg mercury and bromine A few elements exist as gases eg nitrogen oxygen chlorine and hydrogen On the basis of their properties elements are divided into metals nonmetals and metalloids About 80 percent of the elements are metals6 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IX Elements are represented by symbols which are abbreviations for the name of elements A symbol is taken from the name of that element in English Latin Greek or German If it is one letter it will be capital as H for Hydrogen N for Nitrogen and C for Carbon etc In case of two letters symbol only first letter is capital eg Ca for Calcium Na for Sodium and Cl for Chlorine The unique property of an element is valency  It is combining capacity of an element with other elements It depends upon the number of electrons in the outermost shell In simple covalent compounds valency is the number of hydrogen atoms which combine with one atom of that element or the number of bonds formed by one atom of that element eg in the following compoundsThe valency of chlorine oxygen nitrogen and carbon is 1 2 3 and 4 respectively In simple ionic compounds valency is the number of electrons gained or lost by an atom of an element to complete its octet Elements having less than four electrons in their valence shell prefer to lose the electrons to complete their octet For example atoms of Na Mg and Al have 1 2 and 3 electrons in their valence shells respectively They lose these electrons to have valency of 1 2 and 3 respectively On the other hand elements having five or more than five electrons in their valence shells gain electrons to complete their octet For example N O and Cl have 5 6 and 7 electrons in their valence shells respectively They gain 3 2 and 1 electrons respectively to complete their octet Hence they show valency of 3 2 and 1 respectively A radical is a group of atoms that have some charge Valencies of some common elements and radicals are shown in Table 12Major part of a living body is made up of water ie 65 to 80 by massSix elements constitute about 99 of our body mass namely Oxygen 65  Carbon 18 Hydrogen 10  Nitrogen 3 Calcium 15 and Phosphorus 15Potassium Sulphur Magnesium and Sodium constitute 08 of our body mass Whereas Copper Zinc Fluorine Chlorine Iron Cobalt and Manganese constitute only 02 of our body mass7 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IX Table 12 Some Elements and Radicals with their Symbols and Common Valencies Some elements show more than one valency ie they have variable valency For example in ferrous sulphate FeSO  the valency of iron is 2 In ferric sulphate 4Fe SO   the valency of iron is 3 Generally the Latin or Greek name for the element 2 4 3eg Ferrum is modified to end in ous for the lower valency eg Ferrous and to end in ic for the higher valency eg Ferric1212 Compound Compound is a substance made up of two or more elements chemically combined together in a fixed ratio by mass As a result of this combination elements lose their own properties and produce new substances compounds that have entirely different properties Compounds cant be broken down into its constituent elements by simple physical methods For example carbon dioxide is formed when elements of carbon and oxygen combine chemically in a fixed ratio of 1232 or 38 by mass Similarly water is a compound formed by a chemical combination between hydrogen and oxygen in a fixed ratio of 18 by mass8 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IX Compounds can be classified as ionic or covalent Ionic compounds do not exist in independent molecular form They form a three dimensional crystal lattice in which each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions These oppositely charged ions attract each other very strongly as a result ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points These compounds are represented by formula units eg NaCl KBr CuSO 4 The covalent compounds mostly exist in molecular form A molecule is a true representative of the covalent compound and its formula is called molecular formula eg H O HC1 H SO  Ch 2 2 4 4Table 13 Some Common Compounds with their Formulae1213 Mixture When two or more elements or compounds mix up physically without any fixed ratio they form a mixture On mixing up the component substances retain their own chemical identities and properties The mixture can be separated into parent components by physical methods such as distillation filtration evaporation crystallisation or magnetization Mixtures that have uniform composition throughout are called homogeneous mixtures eg air gasoline ice cream Whereas heterogeneous mixtures are those in which composition is not uniform throughout eg soil rock and wood9 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IXTable 14 Difference between a Compound and a Mixture121 Atomic Number and Mass Number The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons present in the nucleus of its atoms It is represented by symbol ‘Z’  As all atoms of an element have the same number of protons in their nuclei they have the same atomic numberAir is a mixture of nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide noble gases and water vapoursSoil is a mixture of sand clay mineral salts water and airMilk is a mixture of water sugar fat proteins mineral salts and vitaminsBrass is a mixture of copper and zinc metalsIt is formed by a chemical combination of atoms of the elementsi Mixture is formed by the simple mixing up of the substancesThe constituents lose their identity and form a new substance having entirely different properties from themii Mixture shows the properties of the constituentsCompounds always have fixed composition by massiii Mixtures do not have fixed compositionThe components cannot be separated by physical meansiv The components can be separated by simple physical methodsEvery compound is represented by a chemical formulav It consists of two or more components and does not have any chemical formulaCompounds have homogeneous compositionvi They may be homogeneous or heterogeneous in compositionCompounds have sharp and fixed melting pointsvii Mixtures do not have sharp and fixed melting pointsCompound MixtureTest yourself12i Can you identify mixture element or compound out of thefollowing Coca cola

Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IX Hence each element has a specific atomic number termed as its identification number For example all hydrogen atoms have 1 proton their atomic number is Zl All atoms in carbon have 6 protons their atomic number is Z6 Similarly in oxygen all atoms have 8 protons having atomic number Z8 and sulphur having 16 protons shows atomic number Z  16 The mass number is the sum of number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom It is represented by symbol A It is calculated as AZn where n is the number of neutrons Each proton and neutron has lamu mass For example hydrogen atom has one proton and no neutron in its nucleus its mass number Al0 1 Carbon atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons hence its mass number A12 Atomic numbers and mass numbers of a few elements are given in Table 15Example 11How many protons and neutrons are there in an atom having A  238 and Z  92 SolutionFirst of all develop data from the given statement of the example and then solve it with the help of data Number of protons  Z  92Table 15 Some Elements along with their Atomic and Mass Numbers11 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IX Number of Neutrons  A  Z  238 – 92  146123 Relative Atomic Mass and Atomic Mass Unit As we know that the mass of an atom is too small to be determined practically However certain instruments enable us to determine the ratio of the atomic masses of various elements to that of carbon12 atoms This ratio is known as the relative atomic mass of the element The relative atomic mass of an element is the average mass of the thatoms of that element as compared to 112 onetwelfth the mass of an atom of carbon12 isotope an element having different mass number but same atomic number Based thon carbon12 standard the mass of an atom of carbon is 12 units and l2 of it comes to be 1 unit When we compare atomic masses of other elements with atomic mass of carbon12 atom they are expressed as relative atomic masses of those elements The unit for relative atomic masses is called atomic mass unit with symbol amu One atomic mass th thunit is 112 the mass of one atom of carbon12  When this atomic mass unit is expressed in grams it isFor example124 How to write a Chemical FormulaCompounds are represented by chemical formulae as elements are represented by symbols Chemical formulae of compounds are written keeping the following steps in considerationi Symbols of two elements are writtenside by side in the order of positive ionfirst and negative ion laterii The valency of each ion is writtenon the right top corner of its 2 symbol eg Na  Ca  CI and O2 Test yourself13It represents the name of thesubstance egH O water2 It tells the name of the elements as present in the compound It indicates the mass of the compound in amus or grams It is in fact one molecule or formula unit of the compound It also representsone mole of the molecules in the balanced chemical equationiv Define relative atomic mass12 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IXiii This valency of each ion is brought to the lower right corner of other ion by crossexchange method eg They are written asiv If the valencies are same they are offset and are not written in the chemicalformula But if they are different they are indicated as such at the same positioneg in case of sodium chloride both the valencies are offset and formula is writtenas NaCl whereas calcium chloride is represented by formula CaCl 2v If an ion is a combination of two or more atoms which is called radical bearing a2 3net charge on it eg SO sulphate and PO phosphate then the net charge4 4represents the valency of the radical The chemical formula of such compounds iswritten as explained in iii and iv writing the negative radical within theparenthesis For example chemical formula of aluminium sulphate is written asAl SO  and that of calcium phosphate as Ca PO  2 4 3 3 4 21241 Empirical formula Chemical formulae are of two types The simplest type of formula is empirical formula It is the simplest whole number ratio of atoms present in a compound The empirical formula of a compound is determined by knowing the percentage composition of a compound However here we will explain it with simple examples The covalent compound silica sand has simplest ratio of 12 of silicon and oxygen respectively Therefore its empirical formula is SiO  Similarly glucose has 2simplest ratio 121 of carbon hydrogen and oxygen respectively Hence its empirical formula is CH O2 As discussed earlier the ionic compounds exist in three dimensional network forms Each ion is surrounded by oppositely charged ions in such a way to form electrically neutral compound Therefore the simplest unit taken as a representative of an ionic compound is called formula unit It is defined as the simplest whole number ratio of ions as present in the ionic compound In other words ionic compounds have only empirical formulae For example formula unit of common salt consists of one Na and one CI ion and its empirical formula is NaCl Similarly formula unit of potassium bromide is KBr which is also its empirical formula1242 Molecular Formula13 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IX Molecules are formed by the combination of atoms These molecules are represented by molecular formulae that show actual number of atoms of each element present in a molecule of that compound Molecular formula is derived from empirical formula by the following relationship Molecular formula  Empirical formulan Where n is 123 and so on For example molecular formula of benzene is C H which is derived from the 6 6empirical formula CH where the value of n is 6 The molecular formula of a compound may be same or a multiple of the empirical formula A few compounds having different empirical and molecular formulae are shown in Table 16Table 16 Some Compounds with their Empirical and Molecular FormulaeSome compounds may have same empirical and molecular formula eg water H 0 2hydrochloric acid HC1 etc125 Molecular Mass and Formula Mass The sum of atomic masses of all the atoms present in one molecule of a molecular substance is its molecular mass For example molecular mass of chlorine Cl  is 710 2amu of water H O is 18 amu and that of carbon oxide CO  is 44 amu2 2Example 12 Calculate the molecular mass of Nitric acid HNO 3Solution Atomic mass of H  1 amu Atomic mass of N  14 amu Atomic

are represented by their formula units Formula mass in such cases is the sum of atomic masses of all the atoms present in one formula unit of a substance For example formula mass of sodium chloride is 585 amu and that of CaCO is 100 amu314 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IXExample 13Calculate the formula mass of Potassium sulphate K SO 2 4Solution Atomic mass of K  39 amu Atomic mass of

of atoms having a charge on it The charge may be positive or negative There are two types of ions ie cations and anions An atom or group of atoms having positive charge on it is called cation The cations are formed when atoms lose electrons from their outermost shells For example Na K are cations The following equations show the formation of cations from atoms An atom or a group of atoms that has a negative charge on it is called anion Anion 2is formed by the gain or addition of electrons to an atom For example Cl and O  Following examples show the formation of an anion by addition of electrons to an atomTable 17 Difference between Atoms and IonsTest yourself14iiiiii Identify the following formulae as formulas or unit molecular formulae H O  CH  C H O  C H O  BaCO  KBr2 2 4 6 12 6

an electron it forms a molecular ion Hence molecular ion or radical is a species having positive or negative charge on it Like other ions they can be cationic molecular ions if they carry positive charge or anionic molecular ions if they carry negative charge Cationic molecular ions are more   abundant than anionic molecular ions For example CH  He  N2  When gases are 4bombarded with high energy electrons in a discharge tube they ionize to give molecular ions Table 18 shows some differences between molecule and molecular ionTable 18 Difference between Molecule and Molecular Ion1312 Free Radicals Free radicals are atoms or group of atoms possessing odd number of unpaired electrons It is represented by putting a dot over the symbol of an element eg H  CI  H C  Free radicals are generated by the homolytic equal breakage of the bond between 3two atoms when they absorb heat or light energy A free radical is extremely reactive species as it has the tendency to complete its octet Table 19 shows some of the differences between ions and free radicals16 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IXTable 19 Difference between Ions and Free Radicals132 Types of Molecules A molecule is formed by the chemical combinations of atoms It is the smallest unit of a substance It shows all the properties of the substance and can exist independently There are different types of molecules depending upon the number and types of atoms combining A few types are discussed here A molecule consisting of only one atom is called monoatomic molecule  For example the inert gases helium neon and argon all exist independently in atomic form and they are called monoatomic molecules If a molecule consists of two atoms it is called diatomic molecule For example hydrogen H  oxygen O  chlorine Cl  and hydrogen chloride HCl2 2 2 If it consists of three atoms it is called triatomic molecule  For example H O and 2CO  If a molecule consists of many atoms it is called polyatomic For example methane 2CH  sulphuric acid H2SO  and glucose C H O 4 4 6 12 6 A Molecule containing same type of atoms is called homoatomic molecule  For example hydrogen H  ozone O  sulphur S  and phosphorus P  are the examples 2 3 8 4of molecules formed by the same type of atoms When a molecule consists of different kinds of atoms it is called heteroatomic molecule For example CO  H O and NH 2

Chemistry  IX23mass of a substance Avogadros Number is a collection of 602 10 particles It is 23represented by symbol N  Hence the 602 10 number of atoms molecules or Aformula units is called Avogadros number that is equivalent to one mole of respective 23substance In simple words 602 10 particles are equal to one mole as twelve eggs are equal to one dozenTo understand the relationship between the Avogadros number and the mole of a substance let us consider a few examplesi 23602 10 atoms of carbon are equivalent to one mole of carbonii 23 2602 10 molecules of H O are equivalent to one mole of wateriii 23602 10 formula units of NaCl are equivalent to one mole of sodium chloride23 23 Thus 602 10 atoms of elements or 602 10 molecules 23of molecular substance or 602 10 formula units of ionic compounds are equivalent to 1 mole For further explanation about number of atoms in molecular compounds or number of ions in ionic compounds let us discuss two examplesi One molecule of water is made up of 2 atoms of hydrogen 23and 1 atom of oxygen hence 2 602 10 atoms of 23hydrogen and 602 10 atoms of oxygen constitute one mole of waterii One formula unit of sodium chloride consists of one sodium ion and one chloride 23 23ion So there are 602 10 number of Na ions and 602 10 CI ions in one mole 23of sodium chloride Thus the total number of ions in 1 mole of NaCl is 1204l0 or 241204 10 152 Mole Chemist secret unit23 A mole is defined as the amountmass of a substance that contains 602 l0 number of particles atoms molecules or formula units It establishes a link between mass of a substance and number of particles as shown in summary of molar calculations It is abbreviated as mol You know that a substance may be an element or compound molecular or ionic Mass of a substance is either one of the following atomic mass molecular mass or formula mass These masses are expressed in atomic mass units amu But when these masses are expressed in grams they are called as molar masses Scientists have agreed that Avogadros number of particles are present in one molar mass of a substance Thus quantitative definition of mole is the atomic mass molecular mass or formula mass of a substance expressed in grams is called moleAmaedo Avogadro17761856 was an Italian scholar He is famous for molecular t h e o r y c o m m o n l y known as Avogadros law In tribute to him the number of particles atoms molecules ions in mole of a 23substance 602 10 is k n o w n a s t h e Avogadros constant19 Unit 1 Fundamentals of Chemistry Chemistry  IXFor exampleAtomic mass of carbon expressed

central science It leads to the discovery of every chemical reaction in any living and nonliving thing based on formation of molecules A reaction in the smallest living organism or in the most developed species like man always takes place through the process of molecule formation Hence it provides basis of molecularity of the physical OF In 1924 de Broglie put forward the theory of dual nature of matter ie matter has both the properties of particles as well as waves He explained the background of two ideas He advocated that these two systems could not remain detached from each other By mathematical evidences he proved that every moving object is attached with waves and every wave has corpuscular nature as well It formulated a basis to understand corpuscular nature of matterTHE OF AT THE OR THE OF Over the course of human history people have developed many interconnected and validated ideas about the physical biological psychological and social worlds Those ideas have enabled successive generations to achieve an increasingly comprehensive and reliable understanding of the human species and its environment The means used to develop these ideas are particular ways of observing thinking experimenting and validating These ways represent a fundamental aspect of the nature of science and reflect how science tends to differ from other modes of knowing It is the union of science mathematics and technology that forms the scientific endeavor and that makes it so successful Although each of these human enterprises has a character and history of its own each is dependent on and reinforces the  A A computer counting with a speed of 10 million atoms a second would take 2 billion years to count one mole of atoms If one mole of marbles were spread over the surface of the Earth our planet would be covered by a 3 miles thick layer of marbles A glass of water which contains about 10 moles of water has more water molecules than the grains of sand in the

The name atom was derived from the Latin thword Atomos meaning indivisible In the beginning of 19 century John Dalton put forward Atomic Theory According to it all matter is made up of very small thindivisible particles called atoms Till the end of 19 century it was considered that thatom cannot be subdivided However in the beginning of 20 century experiments performed by Goldstein J J Thomson Rutherford Bohr and other scientist revealed that atom is made up of subatomic particles like electron proton and neutron Properties of these subatomic particles will be discussed in this chapter21

indivisible hard dense sphere Atoms of the same element are alike They combine in different ways to form compounds In the light of Daltons atomic theory scientists performed a series of experiments But in the late 1800s and early 1900s scientists discovered new subatomic particles In 1886 Goldstein discovered positively charged particles called protons In 1897 JJ Thomson found in an atom the negatively charged particles known as electrons It was established that electrons and protons are fundamental particles of matter Based upon these observations Thomson put forth his “plum pudding ” theory He postulated that atoms were solid structures of positively charge with tiny negative particles stuck inside It is like plums in the puddingCathode rays and Discovery of Electron In 1895 Sir William Crooks performed experiments by passing electric current through gases in a discharge tube at very low pressure He took a glass tube fitted with two metallic electrode which were connected to a high voltage battery The pressure 4inside the tube was kept 10 atm When high voltage current was passed through the gas shiny rays were emitted from the cathode which travel towards the anode as shown in figure 21 These rays were given the name of “cathode rays” as these were originated from the cathodeUnit 2 Structure of Atoms Chemistry  IX 28JJ Thomson 18561940 was a British physicist He was awarded the 1906 Noble Prize in Physics for the discovery of electron and for his work on the conduction of electricity in gasesSir William Crooks 18321919 was a British chemist and physicist He was pioneer of vacuum tubes He worked on spectroscopy  perforated cathode  anodeCanal Rays Battery to vacuum pump The cathode rays were studied in detail and their properties were determined which are given belowi These rays travel in straight lines perpendicular to the cathode surfaceii They can cast a sharp shadow of an opaque object if placed in their pathiii They are deflected towards positive plate in an electric field showing thatthey are negatively chargediv They raise temperature of the body on which they fallv JJ Thomson discovered their chargemass e  m ratiovi Light is produced when these rays hit the walls of the discharge tubevii It was found that the same type of rays were emitted no matter which gasand which cathode was used in the discharge tube All these properties suggested that the nature of cathode rays is independent of the nature of the gas present in the discharge tube or material of the cathode The fact that they cast the shadow of an opaque object suggested that these are not rays but they are fast moving material particles They were given the name electrons Since all the materials produce same type of particles it means all the materials contain electrons As we know materials are composed of atoms hence the electrons are fundamental particles of atomsDiscovery of Proton In 1886 Goldstein observed that in addition to cathode rays other rays were also present in the discharge tube These rays were traveling in opposite direction to cathode rays He used a discharge tube having perforated cathode as shown in figure 22 He found that these rays passed through holes present in the cathode and produced a glow on the walls of the discharge tube He called these rays as canal raysThe properties of these rays were as followingi These rays travel in straight lines in a direction opposite to the cathode raysUnit 2 Structure of Atoms Chemistry  IX 29Fig 22 Discharge tube used for the production of canal raysii Their deflection in electric and magnetic field proved that these arepositively chargediii The nature of canal rays depends upon the nature of gas present in thedischarge tubeiv These rays do not originate from the anode In fact these rays are producedwhen the cathode rays or electrons collide with the residual gas moleculespresent in the discharge tube and ionize them as followsv Mass of these particles was found equal to that of a proton or simple multipleof it The mass of a proton is 1840 times more than that of an electron Thus these rays are made up of positively charged particles The mass and charge of these particles depend upon the nature of the gas in the discharge tube Hence different gases produce different types of positive rays having particles of different masses and different charges Keep in mind that positive particles produced by a gas will be of the same type ie positive rays produced by the lightest gas hydrogen contain protonsDiscovery of Neutron Rutherford observed that atomic mass of the element could not be explained on the basis of the masses of electron and proton only He predicted in 1920 that some neutral particle having mass equal to that of proton must be present in an atom Thus scientists were in search of such a neutral particle Eventually in 1932 Chadwick discovered neutron when he bombarded alpha particles on a beryllium target He observed that highly penetrating radiations were produced These radiations were called neutronProperties of neutron are as followingi Neutrons carry no charge ie they are neutralii They are highly penetratingiii Mass of these particles was nearly equal to the mass of a protonUnit 2 Structure of Atoms Chemistry  IX 30Test yourself21iiiiiiivlarge deflection repelledbacksmalldeflection majority of particlespass undeflected 211 Rutherfords Atomic Model Rutherford performed Gold Foil experiment to understand how negative and positive charges could coexist in an atom He bombarded alpha particles on a 000004 cm thick gold foil Alpha particles are emitted by radioactive elements like radium and 2polonium These are actually helium nuclei He  They can penetrate through matter to some extent He observed the effects of particles on a photographic plate or a screen coated with zinc sulphide as shown in figure 23 He proved that the plumpudding model of the atom was not correctObservations made by Rutherford were as followsi Almost all the particles passed through the foil undeflectedii Out of 20000 particles only a few were deflected at fairly large angles andvery few bounced back on hitting the gold foilResults of the experiment Keeping in view the experiment Rutherford proposed planetary model for an atom and concluded following resultsUnit 2 Structure of Atoms Chemistry  IX 31Fig 23 Scattering of alpha particles by the atoms of gold foili Since most of the particles passed through the foil undeflected therefore most of the volume occupied by an atom is empty ii The deflection of a few particles proved that there is a center of positive charges in an atom which is called nucleus of an atomiii The complete rebounce of a few particles show that the nucleus is very dense and hardiv Since a few particles were deflected it shows that the size of the nucleus is very small as compared to the total volume of an atomv The electrons revolve around the nucleusvi An atom as a whole is neutral therefore the number of electrons in an atom is equal to the number of protonsvii Except electrons all other fundamental particles that lie within the nucleus are known as nucleonsDefects in Rutherfords Model Although Rutherfords experiment proved that the plumpudding model of an atom was not correct yet it had following defectsi According to classical theory of radiation electrons being the charged particles should release or emit energy continuously and they should ultimately fall into the nucleusii If the electrons emit energy continuously they should form a continuous spectrum but in fact line spectrum was observed Although the scientists had objections on the atomic model presented by Rutherford yet it cultivated thought provoking ideas among them They initiated the quest to answer the following questionsiiiiii Scientists considered there must be another model of atom It indicated that Rutherfords model was not perfectUnit 2 Structure of Atoms Chemistry  IX 32Rutherford was a BritishNew Zealand chemist He performed a series of experiments using a particles He won the 1908 Noble Prize in Chemistry In 1911 he proposed the nuclear model of the atom and performed the first experiment to split atom Because of his great contributions he is considered the father of nuclear science212 Bohrs Atomic Theory Keeping in view the defects in Rutherfords Atomic Model Neil Bohr presented another model of atom in 1913 The Quantum Theory of Max Planck was used as foundation for this model According to Bohrs model revolving electron in an atom does not absorb or emit energy continuously The energy of a revolving electron is quantized as it revolves only in orbits of fixed energy called energy levels by him The Bohrs atomic model is shown in figure 24The Bohrs atomic model was based upon the following postulatesi The hydrogen atom consists of a tiny nucleus and electrons are revolvingin one of circular orbits of radius ‘r’ around the nucleusii Each orbit has a fixed energy that is quantizediii As long as electron remains in a particular orbit it does not radiate orabsorb energy The energy is emitted or absorbed only when an electronjumps from one orbit to anotheriv When an electron jumps from lower orbit to higher orbit it absorbs energyand when it jumps from higher orbit to lower orbit it radiates energy Thischange in energy E is given by following Plancks equation34Where h is Plancks constant equal to 663 10 Js and v is frequency of lightv Electron can revolve only in orbits of a fixed angular moment mvr given asWhere n is the quantum number or orbit number having values 123 and so onUnit 2 Structure of Atoms Chemistry  IX 33Neil Bohr was a Danish physicist who joined Rutherford in 1912 for his post doctoral research In 1913 Bohr presented his atomic model based upon Quantum theory He won the 1922 Noble Prize for Physics for his work on the structure of an atomFig 24 Bohrs atomic model showing orbitsTest yourself22Summary of

32 electrons As we know there is a slight difference between the energies of the subshells within a shell therefore filling of electrons in subshells of a shell is such as that V subshell is filled first and then its p subshell and then other subshells are filled The maximum capacity of subshells to accommodate electrons is‘s’ subshell can accommodate 2 electrons‘p’ subshell can accommodate 6 electrons Let us write the electronic configuration of the elements and their ions with the help of a few examples Keep in mind we should know three thingsi The number of electrons in an atomii The sequence of shells and subshells according to the energy levelsiii The maximum number of electrons that can be placed in different shells and subshellsExample 21Write the electronic configuration of an element having 11 electronsSolutionKeep in mind that all electrons do not have the same energy Therefore they are accommodated in differentshells according to increasing energy and capacity of the shell First of all the electrons will go to K shell which has minimum energy It can accommodate 2 electrons After this electrons will go to L shell that can accommodate 8 electrons Thus K and L shells have accommodated 10 electrons The remaining 1 electron will go to M shell the outermost shell of maximum energy in this case The electronic configuration will be written asBut it is not necessary to write the subshells Therefore it is simply written as 28 and 1 Further distribution of electrons in subshells will beExample 22Write down the electronic configuration of Cl ion SolutionWe know that chlorine has 17 electrons and chloride ion Cl  has 17  1  18 electrons Its electronic configuration will be 2 8 8 which is presented in the figure The further distribution of electrons in subshells will beExample 23An element has 5 electrons in M shell Find out its atomic numberUnit 2 Structure of Atoms Chemistry  IX When there are 5 electrons in M shell it means K and L shell are completely filled with their maximum capacity of 10 electrons Hence the electronic configuration of the element isSo the total number of electrons is 2  8  5  15As we know the number of electrons in an atom is equal to its atomic number Therefore atomic number of this element is 15222 The electronic configuration of first 18 elementsThe sequence of filling of electrons in different subshells is as followingWhere number represents the shell number while letters s and p represent subshells The superscript shows the number of electrons in a subshell The sum of superscripts number is the total number of electrons in an atom ie atomic number of an element The electronic configuration of first 18 elements is shown in the Table 21Table 21 Electronic Configuration of First Eighteen ElementsUnit 2 Structure of Atoms Chemistry  IX 3723 Definition Isotopes are defined as the atoms of an element that have same atomic number but different mass numbers They have same electronic configuration and number of protons but they differ in the number of neutrons Isotopes have similar chemical properties because these depend upon electronic configuration But they have different physical properties because these depend upon mass numbers Most of the elements have isotopes Here we will discuss the isotopes of hydrogen carbon chlorine and uranium only232 Examples i Isotopes of HydrogenThe naturally occurring hydrogen is combination of its three isotopes presentin different abundances The three isotopes of hydrogen are named as protiumdeuterium and tritium Each one of them has 1 proton and 1

of them have the same number of protons and electrons but differ in number of neutrons They are represented as follows iii Isotopes of Chlorine There are two isotopes of chlorine iv Isotopes of Uranium There are three isotopes of uranium iein nature nearly 99 The difference in their number of electrons protons and neutrons is shown belowTable 22 Atomic Number Mass Number Number of Protons and Neutrons ofH C CI and U OF In science and many different technological fields isotopes have vast applications The biggest application is in the field of medicine They are applied in diagnosis radiotherapy and treatment of many diseases like cancerUnit 2 Structure of Atoms Chemistry  IX 39233 Uses With the advancement of the scientific knowledge the isotopes have found many applications in our lives Following are the major fields in which isotopes have vast applications i Radiotherapy Treatment of Cancer For the treatment of skin cancer isotopes like P32 and Sr90 are used because they emit less penetrating beta radiations For cancer Co60 affecting within the body is used because it emits strongly penetrating gamma rays ii Tracer for Diagnosis and Medicine The radioactive isotopes are used as tracers in medicine to diagnose the presence of tumor in the human body Isotopes of Iodine131 are used for diagnosis of goiter in thyroid gland Similarly technetium is used to monitor the bone growth iii Archaeological and Geological Uses The radioactive isotopes are used to estimate the age of fossils like dead plants and animals and stones etc The age determination of very old objects based on the halflives of the radioactive isotope is called radioactiveisotope dating An important method of age determination of old carbon containing objects fossils by measuring the radioactivity of C14 in them is called radiocarbon dating or simply carbon dating iv Chemical Reaction and Structure Determination The radioisotopes are used in a chemical reaction to follow a radioactive element during the reaction and ultimately to determine the structure For example C14 is used to label CO  As CO is used by the plants for photosynthesis to form glucose its 2 2movement is detected through the various intermediate steps up to glucose v Applications in Power Generation Radioactive isotopes are used to generate electricity by carrying out controlled nuclear fission reactions in nuclear reactors For example when U235 is bombarded with slow moving neutrons the uranium nucleus breaks up to produce Barium139 and Krypton94 and three neutrons A large amount of energy is released which is used to convert water into steam in boilers The steam then drives the turbines to generate electricity This is the peaceful use of atomic energy for development of a nationUnit 2 Structure of Atoms Chemistry  IX IN Science is a process for producing knowledge The process depends both on making careful observations of phenomenae and inventing theories for making sense out of those observations Change in knowledge is inevitable because new observations may challenge prevailing theories No matter how well one theory explains a set of observations it is possible that another theory may fit just as well or better or may fit a still wider range of observations In science the testing and improving and occasional discarding of theories whether new or old go on all the time Scientists assume that even if there is no way to secure complete and absolute truth increasingly accurate approximations can be made to account for the world and how it worksKey PointsCathode rays

within a group and within a period in the periodic table Introduction In nineteenth century chemists devoted much of their efforts in attempts to arrange elements in a systematic manner These efforts resulted in discovery of periodic law On the basis of this law the elements known at that time were arranged in the form of a table which is known as periodic table One of the significant features of the table was that it predicted the properties of those elements which were not even discovered at that time The vertical columns of that table were called groups and horizontal lines were called periods That orderly arrangement of elements generally coincided with their Periodic Table andPeriodicity of PropertiesTime allocationTeaching periods 12Assessment periods 02Weightage 10increasing atomic number The periodic table contains huge amount of information for scientists31 With the discovery of the periodic table the study of individual properties of the known elements is reduced to study of a few groups We will describe various attempts which were made to classify the elements into a tabular formDobereiners TriadsA German chemist Dobereiner observed relationship between atomic masses of several groups of three elements called triads In these groups the central or middle element had atomic mass average of the other two elements One triad group example is that of calcium 40 strontium88 and barium 137 The atomic mass of strontium is the average of the atomic masses of calcium and barium Only a few elements could be arranged in this way This classification did not get wide acceptanceNewlands OctavesAfter successful determination of correct atomic masses of elements by Cannizzaro in 1860 attempts were again initiated to organize elements In 1864 British chemist Newlands put forward his observations in the form of law of octaves  He noted that there was a repetition in chemical properties of every eighth element if they were arranged by their increasing atomic masses He compared it with musical notes His work could not get much recognition as no space was left for undiscovered element The noble gases were also not known at that timeMendeleevs Periodic TableRussian chemist Mendeleev arranged the known elements only 63 in order of increasing atomic masses in horizontal rows called periods So that elements with similar properties were in the same vertical columnsThis arrangement of elements was called Periodic Table He put forward the results of his work in the form of periodic law which is stated as properties of the elements are periodic functions of their atomic massesAlthough Mendeleev periodic table was the first ever attempt to arrange the elements yet it has a few demerits in it His failure to explain the position of isotopes and wrong order of the atomic masses of some elements suggested that atomic mass of an element cannot serve as the basis for the arrangement of elementsChemistry  IX 45Unit 3 Periodic Table and Periodicity of PropertiesMendeleev 18341907 was a Russian chemist and inventor He was the creator of first version of p e r i o d i c t a b l e o f elements With help of the table he predicted t h e p r o p e r t i e s o f elements yet to be discoveredPeriodic LawIn 1913 H Moseley discovered a new property of the elements ie atomic number He observed that atomic number instead of atomic mass should determine the position of element in the periodic table and accordingly the periodic law was amended as properties of the elements are periodic function of their atomic numbers Atomic number of an element is equal to the number of electrons in a neutral atom So atomic number provides the basis of electronic configurations as wellModern Periodic Table Atomic number of an element is more fundamental property than atomic mass in two respects a It increases regularly from element to element b It is fixed for every element So the discovery of atomic number of an element in 1913 led to change in Mendeleevs periodic law which was based on atomic mass The modern periodic table is based upon the arrangement of elements according to increasing atomic number When the elements are arranged according to increasing atomic number from left to right in a horizontal row properties of elements were found repeating after regular intervals such that elements of similar properties and similar configuration are placed in the same group It was observed that after every eighth element ninth element had similar properties to the first element For example sodium Zll had similar properties to lithium Z3 After atomic number 18 every nineteenth element was showing similar behaviour So the long rows of elements were cut into rows of eight and eighteen elements and placed one above the other so that a table of vertical and horizontal rows was obtainedTest yourself31Atomic number is a more fundamental property than atomic mass because atomic number of every element is fixed and it increases regularly by 1 from element to element No two elements can have the same atomic numberIiiiiiivv State Mendeleevs periodic lawviLong form of Periodic Table The significance of atomic number in the arrangement of elements in the modern periodic table lies in the fact that as electronic configuration is based upon atomic number so the arrangement of elements according to increasing atomic number shows the periodicity repetition of properties after regular intervals in the electronic configuration of the elements that leads to periodicity in their properties Hence the arrangement of elements based on their electronic configuration created a long form of periodic table as shown in figure 31 The horizontal rows of elements in the periodic table are called periods The elements in a period have continuously increasing atomic number ie continuously changing electronic configuration along a period As a result properties of elements in a period are continuously changing The number of valence electrons decides the position of an element in a period For example elements which have 1 electron in their valence shell occupies the left most position in the respective periods such as alkali metals Similarly the elements having 8 electrons in their valence shells such as noble gases always occupy the right most position in the respective periods The vertical columns in the periodic table are called groups  These groups are numbered from left to right as 1 to 18 The elements in a group do not have continuously increasing atomic numbers Rather the atomic numbers of elements in a group increase with irregular gaps But the elements of a group have similar electronic configuration ie same number of electrons are present in their valence shells For example the first group elements have only 1 electron in their valence shells Similarly group 2 elements have 2 electrons in their valence shells It is the reason due to which elements of a group have similar chemical propertiesSalient Features of Long Form of Periodic Tablei This table consists of seven horizontal rows called periodsii First period consists of only two elements Second and third periods consist of8 elements each Fourth and fifth periods consist of 18 elements each Sixthperiod has 32 elements while seventh period has 23 elements and isincompleteiii Elements of a period show different propertiesiv There are 18 vertical columns in the periodic table numbered 1 to 18 from leftto right which are called groupsv The elements of a group show similar chemical propertiesvi Elements are classified into four blocks

the Periodic Table of Elements On the basis of completion of a particular subshell elements with similar subshell electronic configuration are referred as a block of elements  There are four blocks in the periodic table named after the name of the subshell which is in the process of completion by the electrons These are s p d and f blocks as shown in figure 32 For example elements of group 1 and 2 have valence electrons in ‘s’ subshell Therefore they are called sblock elements as shown in figure 32 Elements of group 13 to 18 have their valence electrons in subshell Therefore they are referred as pblock elements The dblock lies between the s and p blocks While fblock lies separately at the bottom dblock constitutes period 45 and 6 Each period consists of ten groups starting from group 3 to group 12 These are called transition metalsChemistry  IX 48 Unit 3 Periodic Table and Periodicity of Properties13 148 4 5 6 7 9 1115 16 171810 12fblockdblockp  blocksblock123311 Periods First period is called short period It consists of only two elements hydrogen and helium Second and third periods are called normal periods Each of them has eight elements in it Second period consists of lithium beryllium boron carbon nitrogen oxygen fluorine and ends at neon a noble gas Fourth and fifth periods are called long periods Each one of them consists of eighteen elements Whereas sixth and seventh periods are called very long periods In these periods after atomic number 57 and 89 two series of fourteen elements each were accommodated Because of space problem these two series were placed separately below the normal periodic table to keep it in a manageable and presentable form Since the two series start after Lanthanum Z57 and Actinium Z89 so these two series of elements are named as Lanthanides and Actinides respectively Table 31 shows the distribution of elements in periods All the periods except the first period start with an alkali metal and end at a noble gas It is to be observed that number of elements in a period is fixed because of maximum number of electrons which can be accommodated in the particular valence shell of the elementsAlchemy For thousand years alchemy remained field of interest for the scientists They worked with two main objectives change common metals into gold and second find cure to diseases and give eternal life to people They believed all kinds of matter were same combination of four basic elements Substances are different because these elements combine differently Changing composition or ratio of any one element new substances can be formed The way of making gold from silver or lead was never found and secret of eternal life was never discovered However many methods and techniques invented by alchemists are still used in chemistryTable 31 Different Periods of the Periodic TableSince new elements are expected to be discovered it is an incomplete period312 Groups Group 1 consists of hydrogen lithium sodium potassium rubidium cesium and francium Although elements of a group do not have continuously increasing atomic numbers yet they have similar electronic configuration in their valence shells That is the reason elements of a group are also called a family For example all the group 1 elements have one electron in their valence shells they are given the family name of alkali metals The groups 1 and 2 and 13 to 17 contain the normal elements In the normal elements all the inner shells are completely filled with electrons only the outermost shells are incomplete For example group 17 elements halogens have 7 electrons in their valence outermost shell The groups 3 to 12 are called transition elements In these elements af subshell is in the process of completion Table 32 shows the distribution of elements in groupsTable 32 Different Groups of the Periodic TableChemistry  IX 50 Unit 3 Periodic Table and Periodicity of Properties32 OF Atomic Size and Atomic Radius As we know that atoms are very small and dont have defined boundaries that fix their size So it is difficult to measure the size of an atom Therefore the common method to determine the size of an atom is to assume that atoms are spheres When they lie close to each other they touch each other Half of the distance between the nuclei of the two bonded atoms is referred as the atomic radius of the atom For example the distance between the nuclei of two carbon atoms in its elemental form is 154 pm its means its half 77 pm is radius of carbon atom as shown in Figure 33 When we move from left to right in a period although atomic number increases yet the size of atoms decreases graduallyTest yourself33Fire WorksBeautiful fireworks display are common on celebrations like Pakistan Day or even on marriages A technology invented in China is used all over the world It is dangerous but careful use of various elements and particularly metal salts of different composition give beauty and colors to the fireworks Elements like magnesium aluminium are used in powdered form Salts of sodium give yellow color calcium  red strontiumscarlet bariumgreen and copperbluish green Usually nitrates and chlorates are used Other chemicals are added to give brilliance and different shades Because of fire hazard and risk to life and property only skilled professionals use themiiiiiiivvviviiviiiixxxixiixiiixivFig 33 The radius of carbon atomatomic number the effective nuclear charge increases gradually because of addition of more and more protons in the nucleus But on the other hand addition of electrons takes place in the same valence shell ie shells do not increase There is gradual increase of effective nuclear charge which increases due to addition of protons This force pulls down or contracts the outermost shell towards the nucleus For example atomic size in period 2 decreases from Li 152 pm to Ne 69 pm The size of atoms or their radii increases from top to bottom in a group It is because a new shell of electrons is added up in the successive period which decreases the effective nuclear charge The trend of atomic size of transition elements has slight variation when we consider this series in a period The atomic size of the elements first reduces or atom contracts and then there is increase in it when we move from left to right in 4th period322 Shielding Effect The electrons present between the nucleus and the outer most shell of an atom reduce the nuclear charge felt by the electrons present in the outer most shell The attractions of outer electrons towards nucleus is partially reduced because of presence of inner electrons As a result valance electron experiences less nuclear charge than that of the actual charge which is called effective nuclear charge Z  It means that the effelectrons present in the inner shells screen or shield the force of attraction of nucleus felt by the valence shell electrons This is called shielding effect  With increase of atomic number the number of electrons in an atom also increases that results in increase of shielding effect The shielding effect increases down the group in the periodic table as shown in the figure 34 Because of this it is easy to take away electron from Potassium Z19 than from Sodium Zll atoms Similarly the shielding effect decreases in a period if we move from left to rightChemistry  IX 52 Unit 3 Periodic Table and Periodicity of

sodium atom496 323 Ionization Energy The ionization energy is the amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from the valence shell of an isolated gaseous atom The amount of energy needed to remove successive electrons present in an atom increases If there is only 1 electron in the valence shell the energy required to remove it will be called first ionization energy For example the first ionization energy of sodium atom 1is  496 kJmol  But when there are more than one electrons in the valence shell they can be removed one by one by providing more and more energy Such as group 2 and 3 elements have more than one electrons in their shells Therefore they will have more than one ionization energy values If we move from left to right in a period the value of ionization energy increases It is because the size of atoms reduces and valence electrons are held strongly by the electrostatic force of nucleus Therefore elements on left side of the periodic table have low ionization energies as compared to those on right side of the periodic table as shown ndfor the 2 period As we move down the group more and more shells lie between the valence shell and the nucleus of the atom these additional shells reduce the electrostatic force felt by the electrons present in the outermost shell Resultantly the valence shell electrons can be taken away easily Therefore ionization energy of elements decreases from top to bottom in a group324 Electron Affinity Electron Affinity is defined as the amount of energy released when an electron is added in the outermost shell of an isolated gaseous atomChemistry  IX 53 Unit 3 Periodic Table and Periodicity of PropertiesIonization energy increasing in a period Ionization energy 1kJmol 5204964194033771st groupIonization energy decreasing in a group Affinity means attraction Therefore electron affinity means tendency of an atom to accept an electron to form an anion For example the electron affinity of fluorine is 328 kJ mol ie one mole atom of fluorine release 328 kJ of energy to form one mole of fluoride ions Let us discuss the trend of electron affinity in the periodic table Electron affinity values increase from left to right in the period The reason for this increase is as the size of atoms decreases in a period the attraction of the nucleus for the incoming electron increases That means more is attraction for the electron more energy will be released In a group electron affinity values decrease from top to bottom because the size of atoms increases down the group With the increase in size of atom shielding effect increases that results in poor attraction for the incoming electron ie less energy is released out For example as the size of iodine atom is bigger than chlorine its electron affinity is less than iodine as given in the adjacent table325 Electronegativity The ability of an atom to attract the shared pair of electrons towards itself in a molecule is called electronegativity It is an important property especially when covalent type of bonding of elements is under consideration The trend of electronegativity is same as of ionization energy and electron affinity It increases in a period from left to right because higher Z shortens distance efffrom the nucleus of the shared pair of electrons This enhances the power to attract the shared pair of electrons For example electronegativity values of group 2 are as followChemistry  IX 54 Unit 3 Periodic Table and Periodicity of PropertiesElectron affinity increasing in a period 0 328141 0 0

form molecules which appear in different states of matter around us The forces responsible for binding the atoms together in a molecule are called chemical forces or chemical bonds These bonding forces which keep the atom together will be discussed in this chapterStructure of MoleculesTime allocationTeaching periods 16Assessment periods 04Weightage 84 It is a universal rule that everything in this world tends to become more stable Atoms achieve stability by attaining electronic configuration of noble gases He Ne or 2 6Ar etc ie ns np  Having 2 or 8 electrons in the valence shell is sign of stability Attaining two electrons in the valence shell is called duplet rule while attaining eight electrons in the valence shell is called octet rule The noble gases do have 2 or 8 electrons in their valence shells It means all the noble gases have their valence shells completely filled Their atoms do not have vacant space in their valence shell to accommodate extra electrons Therefore noble gases do not gain lose or share electrons That is why they are nonreactive The importance of the noble gas electronic configuration lies in the fact that all other atoms try their best to have the noble gas electronic configuration For this purpose atoms combine with one another which is called chemical bonding In other words atoms form chemical bonds to achieve stability by acquiring inert gas electron configuration An atom can accommodate 8 electrons in its valence shell in three waysi By giving valence shell electrons if they are less than three to otheratomsii By gaining electrons from other atoms if the valence shell has five ormore electrons in itiii By sharing valence electrons with other atoms It means every atom has a natural tendency to have 2 or 8 electrons in its valence shell The atoms having less than 2 or 8 electrons in their valence shells are unstable The position of an atom in the periodic table indicates its group number As we have studied in chapter 3 the group number is assigned on the basis of valence shell electrons For example group 1 has only 1 electron in its valence shell and group 17 has 7 electrons in its valence shell Mode of reaction of an atom depends upon its number of valence shell electrons It is discussed in the next sections42 A chemical bond is defined as a force of attraction between atoms that holds them together in a substance In other words during bond formation there is some force which holds the atoms together This attaining of 8 electrons configuration in the outermost shell either by sharing by losing or by gaining electrons is called octet rule This octet rule only symbolizes that noble gas electronic configuration should be attained by atoms when they combine or react For elements like hydrogen or helium which have only Chemistry  IX 59Unit 4 Structure of Moleculesssubshell this becomes duplet rule It plays a significant role in understanding the formation of chemical bond between atoms If the bond formation is between ions it is due to an electrostatic force of attraction between them But if bond formation is between similar atoms or between the atoms that have comparable electronegativities then the chemical bond formation is by sharing of electrons This sharing of electrons may be mutual or one sided When two approaching atoms come closer the attractive as well as repulsive forces become operative The formation of a chemical bond is a result of net attractive forces which dominate The energy of that system is lowered and molecule is formed Otherwise if repulsive forces become dominant no chemical bond will be formed In that case there will be increase in the energy of the system due to creation of repulsive forces43 OF The valence electrons which are involved in chemical bonding are termed as bonding electrons They usually reside in the incomplete or partially filled outermost shell of an atom Depending upon the way how these valence electrons are involved in bonding they result in following four types of chemical bonds Ionic Bond Covalent Bond Dative Covalent or Coordinate Covalent Bond Metallic Bond431 Ionic Bond The elements of Group1 and Group2 being metals have the tendency to lose their valence electrons forming positively charged ions Whereas nonmetals of Group15 to Group17 have the tendency to gain or accept electrons They are electronegative elements with high electron affinities If atoms belonging to these two different groups metals and nonmetals are allowed to react chemical bond is formed This type of chemical bond which is formed due to complete transfer of electron from one atom to another atom is called ionic bond The formation of NaCl is a good example of this type of bond Sodium chloride is a simple compound formed by sodium Z 11 and chlorine Z17 atoms The ground state electronic configuration of these elements is shown belowChemistry  IX 60Unit 4 Structure of Molecules2 2 61s  2s  2p Ne2 2 6 2 61s  2s  2p  3s  3p ArThe frames indicate electrons in the valence shells of these elements sodium has only one electron and chlorine has seven electrons Sodium being electropositive element has the tendency to lose electron and chlorine being an electronegative element has the tendency to gain electron Therefore they form positive and negative ions by losing and gaining electrons respectively They attain electronic configuration to the nearest noble gases By losing one electron from the outermost shell sodium becomes Na ion and it is left with 8 electrons in the second shell which will now become the valence shell By gaining one electron chlorine atom now also has eight electrons in its outermost shell and becomes CI ion Both of these atoms are now changed into oppositely charged ions They stabilize themselves by combining with each other due to electrostatic force of attraction between them such asIt is to be noted that only valence shell electrons take part in this type of bonding while other electrons are not involved In such type of reaction heat is usually given out The compounds formed due to this type of bonding are called ionic compounds 432 Covalent Bond The elements of Group13 to Group17 when allowed to react with each other they form a chemical bond by mutual sharing of their valence shell electrons This type of bond which is formed due to mutual sharing of electrons is called a covalent bond The energy changes during the covalent bond formation are of considerable value When two atoms approach each other attractive forces develop between electrons of one atom and nucleus of the other atom Simultaneously repulsive forces between Chemistry  IX 61Unit 4 Structure of MoleculesTest yourself41iiiiiiivv Why does group 1 elements prefer to combine with group 17elementsvivielectrons of the two atoms as well as between their nuclei are also created When the attractive forces dominate due to decrease in distance between those two atoms a chemical bond is formed between them The formation of hydrogen chlorine nitrogen and oxygen gases are few examples of this type of bondingTypes of covalent bonds As described above the covalent bond is formed by mutual sharing of electrons between two atoms The electrons that pair up to form a chemical bond are called bond pair electrons Depending upon the number of bond pairs covalent bond is classified into following three typesSingle Covalent bond When one electron is contributed by each bonded atom one bond pair is formed and it forms a single covalent bond While drawing the structure of such molecules the single bond pair is indicated by a line between those two atoms A few examples of molecules with single covalent bonds are hydrogen H  chlorine CI  hydrochloric 2 2acid HQ and methane CH 4Double Covalent bond When each bonded atom contributes two electrons two bond pairs are shared and a double covalent bond is formed These bond pairs are indicated as double line between those atoms in the structure of such molecules The molecules like oxygen O  2gas and ethene C H  show such type of double covalent bonds2 4Triple Covalent Bond When each bonded atom contributes three electrons three bond pairs are involved in bond formation This type is called triple covalent bond Three small lines are used to indicate these three pairs of electrons between those atoms in the molecules of H  H H

compounds The examples of molecules having triple covalent bonds are nitrogen N  and ethyne C H 2 2 2By this mutual sharing of valence shell electrons each of the contributing atom attains the Octet or nearest noble gas electronic configuration433 Dative Covalent or Coordinate Covalent Bond Coordinate covalent or dative covalent bonding is a type of covalent bonding in which the bond pair of electrons is donated by one bonded atom only The atom which donates the electron pair is called donor and the atom which accepts the electron pair is called acceptor A small arrow is usually used to indicate the atom and pair of electron being donated The head of arrow is towards the acceptor atom The nonbonded electron pair available on an atom like the one available on nitrogen in ammoniaNH  is called a lone pair When a proton H  approaches a 3molecule with a lone pair of electrons that lone pair is donated to H and a coordinate covalent bond is formed eg formation of ammonium radical NH 4 In the formation of BF 3boron trifluoride molecule three valence electrons of boron atom Z 5 pair up with three electrons one from each three fluorine atoms The boron atom even after this sharing of electrons covalent bond formation remains short or deficit of two electrons in its outermost shell Now if a molecule with a lone pair approaches this molecule it accepts lone pair from that donor and forms a coordinate covalent bond The lone pair on nitrogen of ammonia molecule makes it a good donor molecule to form a coordinate covalent bond as shown in figure 41 N  N N N or N N  N2xxxxxxxxtriple

shared pair of electrons is attracted by both the atoms equally Such type of bond is called nonpolar covalent bond These bonds are formed by equal sharing of electron pair between the two bonding atoms This type of bond is called a pure covalent bond For example bond formation in H and CI2 2 If the covalent bond is formed between two different types of atoms hetroatoms then the bond pair of electrons will not be attracted equally by the bonded atoms One of the atoms will attract the bond pair of electrons more strongly than the other one This atomelement will be called as more electronegative When there is difference of electronegativity between two covalently bonded atoms there will be unequal attraction for the bond pair of electrons between such atoms It will result in the formation of polar covalent bond The difference between electronegativities of hydrogen and chlorine is 10 As the electronegativity of chlorine is more it attracts the shared pair of electron towards itself with a greater force A partial negative charge is therefore created on chlorine and in turn a partial positive charge on hydrogen due to electronegativity difference It creates polarity in the bond and is called polar covalent bond The delta   sign indicates partial positive or partial negative charge that is developed due to unequal sharing of shared pair or bonded pair of electrons The compounds resulting from polar covalent bonds are called polar compounds  For example water hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride By using electronegativity values it is possible to predict whether a chemical bond will be ionic or covalent in nature A bond formed between elements of high electronegativity halogen group and elements of low electronegativity alkali metals are ionic in nature There is complete transfer of electrons between them The bond between elements of comparable electronegativities will be covalent in nature as the bond between carbon and hydrogen in methane or nitrogen and hydrogen in ammonia If the difference of electronegativities between two elements is more than 17 the bond between them will be predominantly ionic bond and if it is less than 17 the bond between two atoms will be predominantly covalentChemistry  IX 64Unit 4 Structure of MoleculesH  Cl H Cl x xxxxxxxxEN  22 EN  32xxxxx Test yourself42435 Metallic Bond The metallic bond is defined as a bond formed between metal atoms positively charged ions due to mobile or free electrons The different properties shown by metals such as high melting and boiling points good conductions of heat and electricity hard and heavy nature suggest existence of different type of chemical bond between atoms of metals In case of metals the hold of nucleus over the outermost electrons is weak because of large sized atoms and greater number of shells in between nucleus and valence electrons Furthermore because of low ionization potentials metals have the tendency to lose their outermost electrons easily Resultantly these loose or free electrons of all metal atoms move freely in the spaces between atoms of a metal None of these electrons is attached to any particular atom Either they belong to a common pool or belong to all the atoms of that metal Nuclei of metal atoms appear submerged in sea of these free mobile electrons These mobile electrons are responsible for holding the atoms of metals together forming a metallic bond A simple metallic bond is shown in figure 42Chemistry  IX 65Unit 4 Structure of Moleculesi Give the electronic configuration of carbon atomiiiiiiv Considering

earlier the forces that hold atoms in a compound are chemical bonds In addition to these strong bonding forces relatively weak forces also exist in between the molecules which are called intermolecular forces The bonding and intermolecular forces of hydrochloric acid are shown below It requires about 17 kJ energy to break these intermolecular forces between one mole of liquid hydrogen chloride molecules to convert it into gas Whereas about 430 kJ energys required to break the chemical bond between hydrogen and chlorine atoms in 1 mole of hydrogen chloride441 Dipole  Dipole Interaction All intermolecular forces which are collectively called van der Waals forces are electrical in nature They result from the attractions of opposite charges which may be temporary or permanent The unequal sharing of electrons between two different types of atoms make one end of molecule slightly positive and other end slightly negatively charged As shared pair of electron is drawn towards more electronegative Chemistry  IX 66Unit 4 Structure of Molecules                     chemical bondintermolecular forcesH Cl H Cl H Cl atom it is partially negatively charged as chlorine in hydrogen chloride The other end automatically becomes partially positively charged When partial positive and partial negative charges exist at different positions in a molecule the adjacent molecules will arrange themselves in such a way that negative end of that molecule comes near to positive end of other molecule It results in a net forces of attraction between oppositely charged ends of two adjacent molecules These attractive forces are called dipole – dipole interactions as represented in HC1442 Hydrogen Bonding Hydrogen bonding is a special type of intermolecular forces present in the permanently polar molecules This bonding can be considered unique dipoledipole attraction This force of attraction develops between molecules that have a hydrogen atom bonded to a small highly electronegative atom with lone pairs of electrons such as nitrogen oxygen and fluorine The covalent bond between hydrogen atom and other atom becomes polar enough to create a partial positive charge on hydrogen atom and a partial negative charge on the other atom The small size and high partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom enables it to attract highly electronegative NO or F atom of the other molecule So partially positively charged hydrogen atom of one molecule attracts and forms a bond with the partially negatively charged atom of the other molecule the bonding is called hydrogen bonding This force of attraction is represented by a dotted line between the molecules as shown belowHydrogen bonding affects the physical properties of the molecules Due to this boiling points of the compounds are affected greatly For example boiling point of water Chemistry  IX 67Unit 4 Structure of Molecules H OHH OHH OHH OH H OHH OHH OHH OH100 °C is higher than that of alcohol 78 °C because of more and stronger hydrogen bonding in water The important phenomenon of floating of ice over water is because of hydrogen 3bonding The density of ice at 0 °C 0917 gem  is less than that of liquid water at 30°C 100 gem  In the liquid state water molecules move randomly However when water freezes the molecules arrange themselves in an ordered form that gives them open structure This process expands the molecules that results in ice being less dense as compared to water45 OF AND Properties of the compounds depend upon the nature of bonding present in them Let us discuss the effects of nature of bonding on the properties of compounds451 Ionic Compounds Ionic compounds are made up of positively and negatively charged ions Thus they consist of ions and not the molecules These positively and negatively charged ions are held together in a solid or crystal form with strong electrostatic attractive forces The orderly arrangement of Na and CI ions in a solid crystal of sodium chloride is shown in figure 43Chemistry  IX 68Unit 4 Structure of MoleculesNa Cl Test yourself43iiiiiiiv Which types of electrons are responsible for holdings the atoms togetherin metalsvvivii viii ix Define intermolecular forces show these forces among HCl molecule Figure 43 Regular arrangement of Na and CI ions in solid crystal of NaCl The ionic compounds have following propertiesi Ionic compounds are mostly crystalline solidsii Ionic compounds in solid state have negligible electrical conductance but theyare good conductors in solution and in the molten form It is due to presenceof free ions in themiii Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points For example sodiumchloride has melting point 800 °C and a boiling point 1413 °C As ioniccompounds are made up of positive and negative ions there exist strongelectrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions So a greatamount of energy is required to break these forcesiv They dissolve easily in polar solvents like water Water has high dielectricconstant that weakens the attraction between ions452 Covalent Compounds The covalent compounds are made up of molecules that are formed by mutual sharing of electrons between their atoms ie covalent bonds A covalent bond is generally regarded as weaker than an ionic bond Covalent compounds are made up of two or more nonmetals eg H  CH  CO  H SO  C H O  Lower molecular mass 2 4 2 2 4 6 12 6covalent compounds are gases or low boiling liquids Contrary to it higher molecular mass covalent compounds are solids General properties shown by covalent compound are as followsi They have usually low melting and boiling pointsii They are usually bad conductors of electricity The compounds having polarcharacter in their bonding are conductor of electricity when they dissolve inpolar solventsiii They are usually insoluble in water but are soluble in nonaqueous solventslike benzene ether alcohol and acetoneiv Large molecules with three dimensional bonding form covalent crystals whichare very stable and hard They have very high melting and boiling pointsPolar and NonPolar Compounds As discussed earlier the polarity in a chemical bond is due to difference in electronegativities of the bonding atoms On the Pauling Scale fluorine has been given an electronegativity value of 40 The values for other elements are calculated relative to it Properties of nonpolar and polar covalent compounds differ to some extent Nonpolar covalent compounds usually do not dissolve in water while polar covalent compounds usually dissolve in water Similarly nonpolar compounds do not conduct electricity but an aqueous solution of a polar compound usually conduct electricity due to the formation of ions as a result of its reaction with waterChemistry  IX 69Unit 4 Structure of Molecules453 Coordinate Covalent Compounds Their properties are mostly similar to those of covalent compounds As the nuclei in these compounds are held by

three physical states ie gas liquid and solid The simplest form of matter is the gaseous state Liquids are less common and most of the matter exists as solid Matter in gaseous state does not have definite shape and volume Therefore gases occupy all the available space Their intermolecular forces are very weak Pressure is a significant property of gases The effect of pressure and temperature on volume of a gas has been studied quite extensively The liquid state has strong intermolecular forces hence it has definite volume but it does not have definite shape It attains the shape of the container in which it is kept Liquids evaporate and their vapours exert pressure When vapour pressure of a liquid becomes equal to external pressure it boils Liquids are less mobile than gases therefore they diffuse slowly The solid state has definite volume and shape They are rigid and denser than liquids and gases They exist in amorphous or crystalline have similar physical properties A few typical properties are discussed here511 Diffusion Gases can diffuse very rapidly Diffusion is defined as spontaneous mixing up of molecules by random motion and collisions to form a homogeneous mixture Rate of diffusion depends upon the molecular mass of the gases Lighter gases diffuse rapidly than heavier ones For example H diffuses four times faster than O gas 2 2512 Effusion It is escaping of gas molecules through a tiny hole into a space with lesser pressure For example when a tyre gets punctured air effuses out Effusion depends upon molecular masses lighter gases effuse faster than heavier gases513 Pressure Gas molecules are always in continuous state of motion Hence when molecules strike with the walls of the container or any other surface they exert pressure Pressure P is defined as the forceF exerted per unit surface area A P  FA2 2The SI unit of force is Newton and that of area is m Hence pressure has SI unit of N m  It is also called Pascal Pa2 One Pascal Pa  1 NmBarometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure and manometer is used to measure pressure in the laboratoryChemistry  IX 76Unit 5 Physical States of MatterStandard Atmospheric Pressure It is the pressure exerted by the atmosphere at the sea level It is defined as the pressure exerted by a mercury column of 760 mm height at sea level It is sufficient pressure to support a column of mercury 760 mm in height at sea level 1 atm  760 mm of Hg  760 torr I mm of Hg  one torr2  101325 Nm  101325 Pa514 CompressibilityGases are highly compressible due to empty spaces between their molecules When gases are compressed the molecules come closer to one another and occupy less volume as compared to the volume in uncompressed state516 Mobility Gas molecules are always in state of continuous motion They can move from one place to another because gas molecules possess very high kinetic energy They move through empty spaces that are available for the molecules to move freely This mobility or random motion results in mixing up of gas molecules to produce a homogeneous mixture517 Density of Gases Gases have low density than liquids and solids It is due to light mass and more 3volume occupied by the gas molecules Gas density is expressed in grams per dm 3Whereas liquid and solid densities are expressed in grams per cm ie liquids and solids are 1000 times denser than gases The density of gases increases by cooling because their volume decreases For example at normal atmospheric pressure the density of oxygen 3 3gas is 14 g dm at 20°C and 15 g dm at 0°C Chemistry

Boyle studied the relationship between the volume and pressure of a gas at constant temperature He observed that volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure provided the temperature remains constantAccording to this law the volume V of a given mass of a gas decreases with the increase of pressure P and vice versa Mathematically it can be written as Where k is proportionality constant The value of k is same for the same amount of a given gas Therefore Boyles law can be stated as the product of pressure and volume of a fixed mass of a gas is constant at a constant temperature As both equations have same constant therefore their variables are also equal to each otherThis equation establishes the relationship between pressure and volume of the gasExperimental Verification of Boyles law The relationship between volume and pressure can be verified experimentally by the following series of experiments Let us take some mass of a gas in a cylinder having a movable piston and observe the effect of increase of pressure on its volume The phenomenon is represented in figure51 When the pressure of 2 atmosphere atm is 3applied the volume of the gas reads as 1 dm When pressure is increased equivalent to 4 3atm the volume of the gas reduces to 05 dm Again when pressure is increased three 3times ie 6 atm the volume reduces to 033 dm Similarly when pressure is increased up 3to 8 atm on the piston volume of the gas decreases to 025 dmChemistry  IX 78Unit 5 Physical States of MatterRobert Boyle 16271691 was natural philosopher chemist physicist and inventor He is famous for Boyles law of gases2 atm 4 atm 6 atm 8 atm1 dm305 dm3033 dm3025 dm3Test yourself5Fig 51 The decrease of volume with increase of pressure When we calculate the product of volume and pressure for this experiment the product of all these experiments is constant ie 2 atm dm It proves the Boyles lawChemistry  IX 79Unit 5 Physical States of MatteriiiiiiBlood pressure is measured using a pressure gauge It may be a mercury manometer or some other device Blood pressure is reported by two values such as 12080 which is a normal blood pressure The first measurement shows the maximum pressure when the heart is pumping It is called systolic pressure When the heart is in resting position pressure decreases and it is the second value called diastolic  Both of these pressures are measured in torr units Hypertension is because of high blood pressure due to tension and worries in daily life The usual criterion for hypertension is a blood pressure greater than 14090 Hypertension raises the level of stress on the heart and on the blood vessels This stress increases the susceptibility of heart attacks and strokesExample 513 A gas with volume 350 cm has a pressure of 650 mm of Hg DataSolutionBy using the equation of Boyles LawBy putting the valuesThus volume of the gas is doubled by reducing its pressure to halfExample 523 785 cm of a gas was enclosed in a container under a pressure of 600 mm Hg DateSolutionBy using the Boyles equation orBy putting the values orThus pressure is increased by decreasing volumeChemistry  IX 80Unit 5 Physical States of MatterAbsolute Temperature Scale Lord Kelvin introduced absolute temperature scale or Kelvin scale This scale of temperature starts from 0 K or 27315 °C which is given the name of absolute zero It is the temperature at which an ideal gas would have zero volume As both scales have equal degree range therefore when 0 K equal to 273 °C then 273 K is equal to 0 °C as shown in the scales Conversion of Kelvin temperature to Celsius temperature and vice versa can be carried out as follows522 Charless Law The relationship between volume and temperature keeping the pressure constant was also studied French scientist J Charles in 1787 presented his law that states the volume of a given mass of a gas is directly proportional to the absolute temperature if the pressure is kept constant When pressure P is constant the volume V of a given mass of a gas is proportional to absolute temperature T Mathematically it is represented as Where k is proportionality constant If temperature of the gas is increased its volume also increases When temperature is changed from T to T  the volume changes 1 2from V to V  The mathematical form of Charles Law will be1 2 As both equations have same value of constant therefore their variables are also equal to each otherChemistry  IX 81Unit 5 Physical States of scale100C200C273 scale 30  273Experimental Verification of Charless Law Let us take a certain amount of gas enclosed in a cylinder having a movable piston If the initial volume of the 3gas V is 50 cm and initial temperature T is 25 °C on heating 1 13the cylinder up to 100 °C its new volume V is about 625 cm  2The increase in temperature increases the volume that can be observed as elaborated below in the figure 52Fig 52 Representation of increase of volume with the increase in temperature Remember Always convert temperature scale from °C to K scale while solving problems K  273  °CExample 533 A sample of oxygen gas has a volume of 250 cm at 30 °C If gas is allowed 3to expand up to 700 cm at constant pressure find out its final temperature DataSolutionBy using the equationBy putting the value in equationThus expansion is caused due to

balloonist He described in 1802 how gases tend to expand Example 543 A sample of hydrogen gas occupies a volume 160 cm at 30 °C If its temperature is raised to 100 °C calculate what will be its volume if the pressure remains constant DataSolution By using the equation of Charles Law By putting the values in above equation Thus volume of the gas has increased by raising the temperature Remember Degree sign ° is used with Celsius scale not with Kelvin scaleChemistry  IX 83Unit 5 Physical States of MatterTest yourself5iiiiiiivvvi Body temperature is measured in Fahrenheit scales Normal body temperature is 986 °F  it is equivalent to 37 °C This temperature is close to average normal atmospheric temperature In winter atmospheric temperature falls lower than that of our body temperatureAccording to principle of heat flow heat flows out from our body and we feel cold To control this outward flow of heat we wear black and warm clothes To maintain body temperature we use dry fruits tea coffee and meats etcPhysical States of Matter and Role of Intermolecular Forces As you know that matter exists in three physical states gas liquid and solid In the gaseous state the molecules are far apart from each other Therefore intermolecular forces are very weak in them But in the liquid and solid states intermolecular forces play a very important role on their properties In the liquid state molecules are much closer to each other as compared to gases as shown in figure 53 As a result liquid molecules develop stronger intermolecular forces which affect their physical properties like diffusion evaporation vapour pressure and boiling point Compounds having stronger intermolecular forces have higher boiling points as you will see in section 533Fig 53 Three states of matter showing intermolecular forces The intermolecular forces become so dominant in solid state that the molecules look motionless They arrange in a regular pattern therefore they are denser than molecules of Liquids have a definite volume but their shape is not definite A liquid attains shape of the container in which it is put A few typical properties of the liquids are discussed here53 Evaporation The process of changing of a liquid into a gas phase is called evaporation It is reverse to condensation in which a gas changes into liquid Evaporation is an endothermic process heat is absorbed Such as when one mole of water in liquid state is converted into vapour form it requires 407 kJ of energy In the liquid state molecules are in a continuous state of motion They possess kinetic energy but all the molecules do not have same kinetic energy Majority of the molecules have average kinetic energy and a few have more than average kinetic energy Chemistry  IX 84Unit 5 Physical States of MatterA Gas molecules B Liquids molecules C Solid moleculesLiquid Vapours vapourize condense The molecules having more than average kinetic energy overcome the attractive forces among the molecules and escape from the surface It is called as evaporation Evaporation is a continuous process taking place at all temperatures The rate of evaporation is directly proportional to temperature It increases with the increase in temperature because of increase in kinetic energy of the molecules Evaporation is a cooling process When the high kinetic energy molecules vapourize the temperature of remaining molecules falls down To compensate this deficiency of energy the molecules of liquid absorb energy from the surroundings As a result the temperature of surroundings decreases and we feel cooling For example when we put a drop of alcohol on palm the alcohol evaporates and we feel cooling effect Evaporation depends upon following factorsi Surface area Evaporation is a surface phenomenon Greater is surface areagreater is evaporation and vice verse For example sometimes a saucer is usedif tea is to be cooled quickly This is because evaporation from the largersurface area of saucer is more than that from the smaller surface area of a teacupii Temperature At high temperature rate of evaporation is high because at hightemperature kinetic energy of the molecules increases so high that they overcome the intermolecular forces and evaporate rapidly For example water levelin a container with hot water decreases earlier than that of a container with coldwater This is because the hot water evaporates earlier than the cold wateriii Intermolecular forces If intermolecular forces are stronger molecules facedifficulty in evaporation For example water has stronger intermolecular forcesthan alcohol therefore alcohol evaporates faster than water532 Vapour Pressure The pressure exerted by the vapours of a liquid at equilibrium with the liquid at a particular temperature is called vapour pressure of a liquid The equilibrium is a state when rate of vapourization and rate of condensation is equal to each other but in opposite directions From the open surface of a liquid molecules evaporate and mix up with the air but when we close a system evaporated molecules start gathering over the liquid surface Initially the vapours condense slowly to return to liquid After sometime condensation process increases and a stage reaches when the rate of evaporation becomes equal to rate of condensation At that stage the number of molecules Chemistry  IX 85Unit 5 Physical States of Matterevaporating will be equal to the number of molecules coming backcondensing to liquid This state is called dynamic equilibrium as shown in figure 54Fig 54 A state of Dynamic Equilibrium between liquid and its vapours Vapour pressure of a liquid depends upon the following factorsi Nature of liquid Vapour pressure depends upon the nature of liquid Polarliquids have low vapour pressure than nonpolar liquids at the sametemperature This is because of strong intermolecular forces between the polarmolecules of liquids For example water has less vapour pressure than that ofalcohol at same temperatureii Size of molecules Small sized molecules can easily evaporate than big sizedmolecules hence small sized molecular liquids exert more vapour pressure Forexample hexane C H  has a small sized molecule as compared to decane 6 14C H  10 22 Therefore C H evaporates rapidly and exerts vapour more pressure than C H 6 14 10 22iii Temperature At high temperature vapour pressure is higher than at lowtemperature At elevated temperature the kinetic energy of the moleculesincreases enough to enable them to vaporize and exert pressure For example vapour pressure of water at different temperatures is given in the Table 51Table 51 Relationship of Vapour Pressure of Water with Temperature533 Boiling Point When a liquid is heated its molecules gain energy The number of molecules which have more than average kinetic energy increases More and more molecules become energetic enough to overcome the intermolecular forces Due to this rate ofChemistry  IX 86Unit 5 Physical States of Mattera b c458175553evaporation increases that results in increase of vapour pressure until a stage reaches where the vapour pressure of a liquid becomes equal to atmospheric pressure At this stage the liquid starts boiling Hence boiling point is defined as the temperature at which the vapour pressure of a liquid becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure or any external pressure The figure 55 shows the increase of vapour pressure of diethyl ether ethyl alcohol and water with the increase of temperature At 0°C the vapour pressure of diethyl ether is 200 mm Hg of ethyl alcohol 25 mm Hg while that of water is about 5 mm Hg When they are heated vapour pressure of diethyl ether increases rapidly and becomes equal to atmospheric pressure at 346°C while vapour pressure of water increases slowly because intermolecular forces of water are stronger The figure shows the vapour pressure increases very rapidly when the liquids are near to boiling pointFig 55 Boiling point curves of Ether Alcohol and Water The boiling point of the liquid depends upon the following factorsi Nature of liquid The polar liquids have higher boiling points than that of nonpolar liquids because polar liquids have strong intermolecular force Boiling points of a few liquids are given in the table 52ii Intermolecular forces Intermolecular forces play a very important role on the boiling point of liquids Substances having stronger intermolecular forces have high boiling points because such liquids attain a level of vapour pressure equal to external pressure at high temperature It is given in figure 55iii External pressure Boiling points of a liquid depends upon external pressure Boiling point of a liquid is controlled by external pressure in such a way thatChemistry  IX 87Unit 5 Physical States of Matter it can be increased by increasing external pressure and vice versa This principle is used in the working of Pressure Cooker534 Freezing Point When liquids are cooled the vapour pressure of liquid decreases and a stage reaches when vapour pressure of a liquid state becomes equal to the vapour pressure of the solid state At this temperature liquid and solid coexist in dynamic equilibrium and this is called the freezing point of a liquid Boiling point and freezing point of a few liquids are given in the table 52Table 52 Freezing and Boiling Points of Common Liquids535 Diffusion The liquid molecules are always in a state of continuous motion They move from higher concentration to lower concentration They mix up with the molecules of other liquids so that they form a homogeneous mixture For example when a few drops of ink are added in a beaker of water ink molecules move around and after a while spread in whole of the beaker Thus diffusion has taken place Liquids diffuse like gases but the rate of diffusion of liquid is very slow The diffusion of liquid depends upon the following factorsi Intermolecular forces Liquids having weak intermolecular forces diffuse faster than those having strong intermolecular forcesii Size of molecules Big sized molecules diffuse slowly For example honeydiffuses slowly in water than that of alcohol in wateriii Shapes of molecules Regular shaped molecules diffuse faster thanirregular shaped molecules because they can easily slip over and movefasteriv Temperature Diffusion increases by increasing temperature because at high temperature the intermolecular forces become weak due to high kinetic energy of the moleculesChemistry  IX 88Unit 5 Physical States of MatterFig 56 Diffusion in liquids536 Density The density of liquid depends upon its mass per unit volume Liquids are denser than gases because molecules of liquid are closely packed and the spaces between their molecules are negligible As the liquid molecules have strong intermolecular forces hence they cannot expand freely and have a fixed volume Like gases they cannot occupy all the available volume of the container that is the reason why densities of 3 3liquids are high For example density of water is 10 g cm while that of air is 0001 g cm  That is the reason why drops of rain fall downward The densities of liquids also vary You can observe kerosene oil floats over water while honey settles down in the It is third state of matter which has definite shape and volume In solid state the molecules are very close to one another and they are closely packed The intermolecular forces are so strong that particles become almost motionless Hence they cannot diffuse Solid particles possess only vibrational motion54 Solids exhibit typical properties a few of which are discussed here541 Melting point The solid particles possess only vibrational kinetic energy When solids are heated their vibrational energies increase and particles vibrate at their mean position with a higher speed If the heat is supplied continuously a stage reaches at which the particles leave their fixed positions and then become mobile At this temperature solid melts The temperature at which the solid starts melting and coexists in dynamic equilibrium with liquid state is called melting point The ionic and covalent solids make network structure to form macromolecules So all such solids have very high melting points542 RigidityThe particles of solids are not mobile They have fixed positions Therefore solids are rigid in their structureTest yourself54Chemistry  IX 89Unit 5 Physical States of MatterIiiiiiivvviviiviii543 Density Solids are denser than liquids and gases because solid particles are closely packed and do not have empty spaces between their particles Therefore they have the highest densities among the three states of matter For example density of aluminium is 3 3 3270 g cm  iron is 786 g cm and gold is 193 g cm 55 Types of Solids According to their general appearance solids can be classified into two types amorphous solids and crystalline solids551 Amorphous Solids Amorphous means shapeless Solids in which the particles are not regularly arranged or their regular shapes are destroyed are called amorphous solids They do not have sharp melting points Plastic rubber and even glass are amorphous solids as they do not have any sharp melting points552 Crystalline Solids Solids in which particles are arranged in a definite threedimensional pattern are called crystalline solids They have definite surfaces or faces Each face has definite angle with the other They have sharp melting points Examples of crystalline solids are diamond sodium chloride etc56 Allotropy The existence of an element in more than one forms in same physical state is called allotropy Allotropy is due toi The existence of two or more kinds of molecules of an element eachhaving different number of atoms such as allotropes of oxygen are oxygenO  and ozone O 2 3ii Different arrangement of two or more atoms or molecules in a crystal ofthe element Such as sulphur shows allotropy due to different arrangementof molecules S  in the crystals8 They always show different physical properties but have same chemical properties Allotropes of solids have different arrangement of atoms in space at a given temperature The arrangement of atoms also change with the change of temperature and new allotropic form is produced The temperature at which one allotrope changes into another is called transition temperature For example transition temperature of sulphur is 96 °C Below this temperature rhombic form is stable If rhombic form is heated above 96 °C its molecules rearrange themselves to give monoclinic formOther examples are tin and phosphorusChemistry  IX 90Unit 5 Physical States of MatterWhite phosphorus is very reactive poisonous and waxy solid It exists as tetraatomic molecules While red phosphorous is less reactive nonpoisonous and a brittle powderCuring with salt to preserve meat Table salt is the most important ingredient for curing meat and is used in large quantities Salt kills and inhibits the growth of putrifying bacteria by drawing water out of the meat Concentrations of salt up to 20 are required to kill most species of unwanted bacteria Once properly salted the meat contains enough salt to prevent the growth of many undesirable OF AS THE There are many aspects to be considered about the functioning of instruments Scientific observation is determined by the human sensory system It generally relies on instruments that serve as mediators between the world and the senses Thus instruments can be considered as a reinforcement of the senses They provide a great capacity for

we breathe is a solution of several gases brass is a solid solution of Zn and Cu Sugar dissolved in water is an example of liquid solution The simplest way to distinguish between a solution and a pure liquid is evaporation The liquid which evaporates completely leaving no residue is a pure compound while a liquid which leaves behind a residue on evaporation is solution An alloy like brass or bronze is also a homogeneous mixture Although it cannot be separated by physical means yet it is considered a mixture as It shows the properties of its components and i It has a variable composition ii 611 Aqueous Solutions The solution which is formed by dissolving a substance in water is called an aqueous solution  In aqueous solutions water is always present in greater amount and termed as solvent For example sugar in water and table salt in water Aqueous solutions are mostly used in the laboratories Water is called a universal solvent because it dissolves majority of compounds present in earths crust612 Solute The component of solution which is present in smaller quantity is called solute A solute is dissolved in a solvent to make a solution For example salt solution is made by dissolving salt in water So in salt solution salt is the solute and water is solvent More than one solutes may be present in a solution For example in soft drinks water is a solvent while other substances like sugar salts and CO are solutes2613 Solvent The component of a solution which is present in larger quantity is called solvent Solvent always dissolves solutes In a solution if more than two substances are present one substance acts as solvent and others behave as solutes For exampleChemistry  IX 97Unit 6 Solutionsas referred above in soft drinks water is solvent while other substances like sugar salts and CO are solutes262 When a small amount of solute is added in a solvent solute dissolves very easily in the solvent If the addition of solute is kept on a stage is reached when solvent cannot dissolve any more solute At this stage further added solute remains undissolved and it settles down at the bottom of the container A solution containing maximum amount of solute at a given temperature is called saturated solution On the particle level a saturated solution is the one in which undissolved solute is in equilibrium with dissolved solute At this stage dynamic equilibrium is established Although dissolution and crystallization continues at a given temperature but the net amount of dissolved solute remains constant621 Unsaturated Solution A solution which contains lesser amount of solute than that which is required to saturate it at a given temperature is called unsaturated solution Such solutions have the capacity to dissolve more solute to become a saturated solution622 Supersaturated Solution When saturated solutions are heated they develop further capacity to dissolve more solute Such solutions contain greater amount of solute than is required to form a saturated solution and they become more concentrated The solution that is more concentrated than a saturated solution is known as supersaturated solution Supersaturated solutions are not stable Therefore an easy way to get a supersaturated solution is to prepare a saturated solution at high temperature It is then cooled to a temperature where excess solute crystallizes out and leaves behind a saturated solution For example a saturated solution of sodium thiosulphate Na S O  in water at 20 °C has 209 g of salt 2 2 33 3per 100 cm of water Less than this amount of salt per 100 cm of water at 20 °C will be an 3unsaturated solution A solution having more amount than 209 g of salt per 100 cm of water at 20 °C will be a supersaturated solutuionChemistry  IX 98Unit 6 Solutions623 Dilution of Solution The solutions are classified as dilute or concentrated on the basis of relative amount of solute present in them Dilute solutions are those which contain relatively small amount of dissolved solute in the solution Concentrated solutions are those which contain relatively large amount of dissolved solute in the solution For example brine is a concentrated solution of common salt in water These terms describe the concentration of the solution Addition of more solvent will dilute the solution and its concentration decreases The preparation of dilute solutions from concentrated solutions has been explained in Section 643163 OF Each solution consists of two components solute and solvent The solute as well as solvent may exist as gas liquid or solid So depending upon the nature of solute and solvent different types of solutions may form which are given in table 61Table 61 Different Types of Solutions with ExamplesChemistry  IX 99Unit 6 Solutions64 Concentration is the proportion of a solute in a solution It is also a ratio of the amount of solute to the amount of solution or ratio of amount of solute to the amount of the solvent Please keep in mind that concentration does not depend upon the total volume or total amount of the solution For example a sample taken from the bulk solution will have the same concentration There are various types of units uspd to express concentration of solutions A few of these units are discussed here641 Percentage Percentage unit of concentration refers to the percentage of solute present in a solution The percentage of solute can be expressed by mass or by volume It can be expressed in terms of percentage composition by four different ways6411 Percentage  massmass mm It is the number of grams of solute in 100 grams of solution For example 10 mm sugar solution means that 10 g of sugar is dissolved in 90 g of water to make 100 g of solution Calculation of this ratio is carried out by using the following formula6412 Percentage  massvolume mv3 It is the number of grams of solute dissolved in 100 cm parts by volume of the 3solution For example 10  mv sugar solution contains 10 g of sugar in 100 cm of the solution The exact volume of solvent is not mentioned or it is not known mv massmassmassmass massmass massChemistry  IX 100Unit 6 SolutionsTest yourself61iii Distinguish between the following pairs as compound orsolution a water and salt solution b vinegar and benzene c carbonated drinks and acetoneiiiivv Dead sea is so rich with salts that it forms crystals whentemperature lowers in the winter6413 Percentage  volumemass vm3 It is the volume in cm of a solute dissolved in 100 g of the solution For example 10  vm alcohol solution in water means 10 cm of alcohol is dissolved in unknown volume of water so that the total mass of the solution is 100 g In such solutions the mass of solution is under consideration total volume of the solution is not considered6414 Percentage  volume volume  vv3 3 It is the volume in cm of a solute dissolved per 100 cm of the solution For example 30 percent alcohol solution means 30 cm of alcohol dissolved in sufficient 3amount of water so that the total volume of the solution becomes 100 cmExample 613 3 If we add 5 cm of acetone in water to prepare 90 cm of aqueous solution Calculate the concentrationvv of this solutionSolution Thus concentration of solution is 55 percent by volume 642 Molarity It is a concentration unit defined as number of moles of solute dissolved in one 3dm of the solution It is represented by M Molarity is the unit mostly used in chemistry and allied sciences The formula used for the preparation of molar solution is as follows vm volumevolumeof theof theChemistry  IX 101Unit 6 Solutions6421 Preparation of Molar Solution One Molar solution is prepared by dissolving 1 mole molar mass of the solute 3in sufficient amount of water to make the total volume of the solution up to 1 dm in a measuring flask For example 1M solution of NaOH is prepared by dissolving 40 g of 3NaOH in sufficient water to make the total volume 1 dm As amount of solute is increased its concentration or molarity also increases 20 M solution is more concentrated than 10 M solution 643 Problems involving the molarity of a solution The following solved examples will help you to understand how molar

the number of grams of the solute dissolved in 100 g of a solvent to prepare a saturated solution at a particular temperature The concentration of a saturated solution is referred to as solubility of the solute in a given solventFollowing are the factors which affect the solubility of solutes1 The general principle of solubility is like dissolves like The ionic and polar substances are soluble in polar solvents Ionic solids iand polar covalent compounds are soluble in water eg KC1 Na CO  2 3CuSO  sugar and alcohol are all soluble in water4 Nonpolar substances are not soluble in polar solvents Nonpolar iicovalent compounds are not soluble in water such as ether benzene and petrol are insoluble in water Nonpolar covalent substances are soluble in nonpolar solvents mostly iiiorganic solvents Grease paints naphthalene are soluble in ether or carbon tetrachloride etc2 Solutesolvent interaction3 TemperatureChemistry  IX 104Unit 6 Solutions651 Solubility and Solutesolvent interaction The solutesolvent interaction can be explained in terms of creation of attractive forces between the particles of solute and those of solvent To dissolve one substance solute in another substance solvent following three events must occur  Solute particles must separate from each other i Solvent particles must separate to provide space for solute particles ii Solute and solvent particles must attract and mix up iii Solution formation depends upon the relative strength of attractive forces between solutesolute solventsolvent and solutesolvent Generally solutes are solids Ionic solids are arranged in such a regular pattern that the interionic forces are at a maximum If the new forces between solute and solvent particles overcome the solutesolute attractive forces then solute dissolves and makes a solution If forces between solute particles are strong enough than solutesolvent forces solute remains insoluble and solution is not formed Figure 62 shows dissolution process by the interaction of solvent molecules with the solute ions The solvent molecules first pull apart the solute ions and then surround them In this way solute dissolves and solution forms For example when NaCl is added in water it dissolves readily because the attractive interaction between the ions of NaCl and polar molecules of water are strong enough to overcome the attractive forces  between Na and Cl ions in solid NaCl crystal In this process the positive end of the water dipole is oriented towards the CI ions and the negative end of water dipole is oriented towards the   Na ions These iondipole attractions between Na ions and water molecules Cl ions and water molecules are so strong that they pull these ions from their positions in the crystal and thus NaCl dissolves It is shown in the figure 62652 Effect of Temperature on solubility Temperature has major effect on the solubility of most of the substances Generally it seems that solubility increases with the increase of temperature but it is not always true When a solution is formed by adding a salt in solvent there areChemistry  IX 105Unit 6 62 Interaction of solute and solvent to form solution 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 00 10 20 30 40

possibilities are discussed herei Heat is absorbedWhen salts like KNO  NaNO and KC1 are added in water the test tube becomes cold It 3 3means during dissolution of these salts heat is absorbed Such dissolving process is called endothermic’  Solubility usually increases with the increase in temperature for such solutes It means that heat is required to break the attractive forces between the ions of solute This requirement is fulfilled by the surrounding molecules As a result their temperature falls down and test tube becomes coldFig 63 Effect of temperature on solubility of different salts in waterii Heat is given out On the other hand when salts like Li SO and Ce SO  are dissolved in water 2 4 2 4 3the test tube becomes warm ie heat is released during this dissolution In such cases the solubility of salt decreases with the increase of temperature In such cases attractive forces among the solute particles are weaker and solutesolvent interactions are stronger As a result there is release of energyChemistry  IX 106Unit 6 Solutionsiii No change in heat In some cases during a dissolution process neither the heat is absorbed nor released When salt like NaCl is added in water the solution temperature remains almost the same In such case temperature has a minimum effect on solubility Figure 63 shows the trend of solubilities of different salts with the increase in temperature66 OF AND Solution Solutions are the homogeneous mixtures of two or more than two components Each component is mixed in such a way that their individual identity is not visible The simplest example is that of a drop of ink mixed in water This is an example of true solution662 Colloid These are solutions in which the solute particles are larger than those present in the true solutions but not large enough to be seen by naked eye The particles in such system dissolve and do not settle down for a long time But particles of colloids are big enough to scatter the beam of light It is called Tyndall effect We can see the path of scattered light beam inside the colloidal solution Tyndall effect is the main characteristic which distinguishes colloids from solutions Hence these solutions are called false solutions or colloidal solutions Examples are starch albumin soap solutions blood milk ink jelly and toothpaste etcChemistry  IX 107Unit 6 SolutionsSolution no scattering of light Colloids

Electrochemistry is the branch of Chemistry that deals with the relationship between electricity and chemical reactions It involves oxidation and reduction reactions which are also known as redox reactions Redox reactions either take place spontaneously and produce electricity or electricity is used to drive nonspontaneous reactions Spontaneous reactions are those which take place on their own without any external agent Nonspontaneous reactions are those which take place in the presence of an external agent These reactions take place in galvanic or electrolytic cells Electrolysis of fused sodium chloride produces sodium metal and that of brine solution produces sodium hydroxide The corrosion process of iron along with its preventions are discussed in detail71 AND One concept of oxidation and reduction is based upon either addition or removal of oxygen or addition or removal of hydrogen in a chemical reaction So according to this concept Oxidation is defined as addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen during a chemical reaction Reduction is defined as addition of hydrogen or removal of oxygen during a chemical reaction Both of these processes take place simultaneously in a reaction we can say where there is oxidation there is reduction Let us first discuss an example to understand the concept based on addition and removal of oxygen A reaction between zinc oxide and carbon takes place by the removal of oxygen reduction from zinc oxide and addition of oxygen oxidation to carbon It is represented as Let us have another example based upon removal or addition of hydrogenA reaction between hydrogen sulphide and chlorine takes place by oxidation ofChemistry  IX 114Unit 7 Electrochemistry • Describe the method of recovering metal from its ore • Explain electrolytic refining of copper • Define corrosion • Describe rusting of iron as an example of corrosion • Summarize the methods used to prevent corrosion • Explain electroplating of metals on steel using examples of zinc tin and chromium platinghydrogen sulphide and reduction of chlorine Hydrogen is being removed from H2S and added to chlorine It is represented as So a chemical reaction in which oxidation and reduction processes are involved is called oxidation reduction reaction or redox reaction711 Oxidation and Reduction in Terms of Loss or Gain of Electron In chemistry there are many chemical reactions which do not involve oxygen or hydrogen but they are considered redox reactions To deal with these reactions new concept loss or gain of electrons is used Therefore reactions which involve loss or gain of electrons are also called oxidation and reduction reactions According to this conceptOxidation is loss of electrons by an atom or an ion egReduction is gain of electrons by an atom or ion egThe overall redox reaction is sum of both processes written as Let us have another simple example to understand this concept A reaction between sodium metal and chlorine takes place in three steps First sodium atom losses an electron to form sodium ion such as Simultaneously this electron is accepted by chlorine atom reduction process as chlorine atom needs one electron to complete its octet As a result chlorine atom changes to chloride ion Such as Ultimately both these ions attract each other to form sodium chloride Complete redox reaction is sum of the oxidation and reduction reactions between sodium and chlorine atoms and it is represented asChemistry  IX 115Unit 7 Electrochemistry Keep in mind chlorine element exists as a molecule CI  not as atoms CI 2Therefore the actual balanced chemical reaction is represented asWe can summarize all these concepts asChemistry  IX 116Unit 7 Electrochemistryi How can you justify that a reaction between magnesium and oxygen is a redox reaction while the reaction shows only addition of oxygen oxidationii A reaction between carbon and oxygen involved only addition of oxygen oxidation but it is called a redox reaction Comment on thisiii Oxidation and reduction proceed simultaneously Explain with an exampleiv Identify which of the following is oxidation or reduction reactionv An element M reacts with another element X to form

complete redox reactionvii Explain the term oxidation on the basis of electronic concept with an example72 AND FOR state or oxidation number ON is the apparent charge assigned to an atom of an element in a molecule or in an ion For example in HC1 oxidation number of H is  1 and that of CI is 1Rules for assigning oxidation numbers ONI The oxidation number of all elements in the free state is zeroii The oxidation number of an ion consisting of a single element is the same as thecharge on the ioniii The oxidation number of different elements in the periodic table is in Group 1 itis 1 in Group 2 it is 2 and in Group 13 it is 3iv The oxidation number of hydrogen in all its compounds is 1 But in metalhydrides it is 1v The oxidation number of oxygen in all its compounds is 2 But it is 1 inperoxides and 2 in OF 2vi In any substance the more electronegative atom has the negative oxidationnumbervii In neutral molecules the algebraic sum of the oxidation numbers of all theelements is zeroviii In ions the algebraic sum of oxidation number equals the charge on the ion Remember It is important to note that while assigning oxidation numbers the sign precedes the number It is written as 2 Whereas the apparent charge on an atom ion or molecule which is called valency  is written as the sign followed by the number ie 2Example 71 Find oxidation number of nitrogen in HNO when the oxidation numbers of H 3 1 and O  2Solution By applying formula in compound sum of all oxidation numbers is zero In case of this compound HNO it becomes3 Putting the values in above formulaChemistry  IX 117Unit 7

Find out the oxidation number of chlorine in  3As ON of K  1 and ON of O  2SolutionPutting the values in formula we get73 AND An oxidizing agent is the specie that oxidise a substance by taking electrons from it The substance atom or ion which is reduced itself by gaining electrons is also called oxidizing agent Nonmetals are oxidizing agents because they accept electrons being more electronegative elements Reducing agent is the specie that reduces a substance by donating electron to it The substance atom or ion which is oxidized by losing electrons is also called reducing agent Almost all metals are good reducing agents because they have theChemistry  IX 118Unit 7 Electrochemistryi Find out the oxidation numbers of the following elements marked in bold inthe formulaeii In a

element changes from 5 to 3tendency to lose electrons An outline of oxidation and reduction processes is given below74  Chemical reactions in which the oxidation state of one or more substances changes are called oxidationreduction or redox reactions Following are the examples of redox reactions Each reaction system consists of oxidizing and reducing agents Let us discuss a reaction of zinc metal with hydrochloric acid The oxidation states or oxidation numbers of all the atoms or ions in this reaction are indicated below Let us find out the atoms that are oxidized or reduced or whether there is a change in their oxidation state it is indicated as follows Similarly in the case of formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen gases redox reaction takes place as follows The oxidation

to the battery Electrochemical cell is an energy storage device in which either a chemical reaction takes place by using electric current electrolysis or chemical reaction produces electric currentelectric conductance Electrochemical cells are of two types i Electrolytic cells ii Galvanic cells751 Concept of Electrolytes The substances which can conduct electricity in their aqueous

Electrolytes are classified into two groups depending upon their extent of ionization in solution7511 Strong Electrolytes The electrolytes which ionize almost completely in their aqueous solutions and produce more ions are called strong electrolytes Example of strong electrolytes are aqueous solutions of NaCl NaOH and H SO  etc2 47512 Weak Electrolytes The electrolytes which ionize to a small extent when dissolved in water and could not produce more ions are called weak electrolytes Acetic acid CH and 3CaOH when dissolved in water ionize to a small extent and are good examples of 2weak electrolytes Weak electrolytes do not ionize completely For example ionization of acetic acid in water produces less ionsAs a result the weak electrolyte is a poor conductor of electricity7513 NonElectrolytes The substances which do not ionize in their aqueous solutions and do not allow the current to pass through their solutions are called nonelectrolytes For example sugar solution and benzene are nonelectrolytes752 Electrolytic cells The type of electrochemical cell in which a nonspontaneous chemical reaction takes place when electric current is passed through the solution is called an electrolytic cell The process that takes place in an electrolytic cell is called electrolysis It is defined as the chemical decomposition of a compound into its components by passing current through the solution of the compound or in the molten state of the compound Examples of these cells are Downs cell Nelsons cell7521 Construction of an Electrolytic Cell An electrolytic cell consists of a solution of an electrolyte two electrodesChemistry  IX 121Unit 7 ElectrochemistryFig 71 Electrolytic cellanode and cathode that are dipped in the electrolytic solution and connected to the battery The electrode connected to positive terminal is called anode and electrode connected to the negative terminal is called cathode as shown in figure 717522 Working of an Electrolytic Cell When electric current is applied from battery the ions in the electrolyte migrate to their respective electrodes The anions which are negatively charged move towards the anode and discharge there by losing their electrons Thus oxidation takes place at anode While cations which are positively charged ions move towards cathode Cations gain electrons from the electrode and as a result reduction takes place at cathode For example when fused salt of sodium chloride is electrolysed the following reactions take place during this process Oxidation reaction at anode Reduction reaction at cathode Overall reaction7523 Electrolysis of Water Pure water is a very weak electrolyte It ionizes to a very small extent The   7 3concentrations of hydrogen ions H  and hydroxyl ions OH  are both at 10 mol dm respectively When a few drops of an acid are added in water its conductivity improves When an electric current is passed through this acidified water OH anions move towards positive electrode anode and H cations move towards negative electrode cathode and discharge takes place at these electrodes They produce oxygen and hydrogen gases respectively at anode and cathode as shown in figure 72Chemistry  IX 122Unit 7 ElectrochemistryFig 72 Electrolytic cell showing electrolysis of water The redox reaction taking place in the electrolytic bath can be shown as following Oxidation reaction at anode Reduction reaction at cathode Overall reaction753 Galvanic Cell The electrochemical cell in which a spontaneous chemical reaction takes place and generates electric current is called galvanic or voltaic cell  Example of this type of cell is a Daniel cell7531Construction of a Daniel Cell A galvanic cell consists of two cells each called as halfcell  connected electrically by a salt bridge In each of the halfcell an electrode is dipped in 1 M solution of its own salt and connected through a wire to an external circuit Figure73 shows a typical galvanic cellChemistry  IX 123Unit 7 ElectrochemistryAnode  Cathode Platinumelectrodes WaterHydrogen gas Oxygen gasBattery A Volta 17451827 was an Italian physicist known especially for the development of the first electric cell in 1800 The left halfcell consists of an electrode of zinc metal dipped in 1 M solution of zinc sulphate The right half cell is a copper electrode dipped in I M solution of copper sulphate Salt bridge is a U shaped glass tube It consists of saturated solution of strong electrolyte supported in a jelly type material The ends of the U tube are sealed with a porous material like glass wool The function of the salt bridge is to keep the solutions of two half cells neutral by providing a pathway for migration of ions7532 Working of the Cell The Zn metal has tendency to lose electrons more readily than copper As a result oxidation takes place at Znelectrode The electrons flow from Znelectrode through the external wire in a circuit to copper electrode These electrons are gained by the copper ions of the solution and copper atoms deposit at the electrode The respective oxidation and reduction processes going on at two electrodes are as follows Halfcell reaction at anode oxidation Halfcell reaction at cathode reduction Overall galvanic reaction is the sum of these two halfcell reactions As a result of redox reaction electric current is produced The batteries which are used for starting automobiles running calculators and toys and to lit the bulbs work on the same principleChemistry  IX 124Unit 7 ElectrochemistryZinc sulphate solution Copper sulphate solution76 Manufacture of Sodium

CI gas at 2the anode It is collected over the anode within an inverted coneshaped structure While Na are reduced at cathode and molten Na metal floats on the denser molten salt mixture from where it is collected in a side tube Following reactions take place during the electrolysis of the molten sodium chloride Molten NaCl ionizes as Halfcell reaction at anode oxidation Halfcell reaction at cathode reduction Overall galvanic reaction is the sum of these two halfcell reactions762 Manufacture of NaOH from Brine On industrial scale caustic soda sodium hydroxide NaOH is produced in Nelsons cell by the electrolysis of aqueous solution of NaCl called brine The schematic diagram of the cell is shown in figure 75 It consists of a steel tank in which graphite anode is suspended in the center of a U shaped perforated iron cathode This iron cathode is internally lined with asbestos diaphragm Electrolyte brine is present inside the iron cathodeChemistry  IX 126Unit 7 ElectrochemistryFig 74 Downs Cell for production of Sodium Metal4OH 4eWorking of Nelsons Cell  Aqueous solution of sodium chloride consists of Na  CI  H and OH ions These ions move towards their respective electrodes and redox reactions take place at these electrodes When electrolysis takes place Cl ions are discharged at anode and CI 2gas rises into the dome at the top of the cell The H ions are discharged at cathode and H 2gas escapes through a pipe The sodium hydroxide solution slowly percolates into a catch basin Brine ionizes to produce ions Reaction at anode oxidation Reaction at cathode reduction Overall

surrounding medium It is a redox chemical reaction that takes place by the action of air and moisture with the metals The most common example of corrosion is rusting of iron771 Rusting of Iron Corrosion is a general term but corrosion of iron is called rusting The important condition for rusting is moist air air having water vapours in it There will be no rusting in water vapours free of air or air free of water Now we study the chemistry of the rusting process Stains and dents on the surface of the iron provide the sites for this process to occur This region is called anodic region and following oxidation reaction takes place here This loss of electrons damage the object The free electrons move through iron sheet until they reach to a region of relatively high O concentration near the surface 2surrounded by water layer as shown in figure 76 This region acts as cathode and electrons reduce the oxygen molecule in the presence of H ions The H ions are provided by the carbonic acid which is formed because of presence of CO in water That is why acidic medium accelerates the process of rusting2 The overall redox process is completed without the formation of rust2 The Fe formed spreads through out the surrounding water and react with O to 2form the salt Fe O nH O which is called rust It is also a redox reaction2 3 2 The rust layer of iron is porous and does not prevent further corrosion Thus rusting continues until the whole piece of iron is eaten awayChemistry  IX 128Unit 7 ElectrochemistryFig 76 Rusting of ironAluminium corrodes but it does not rust Rust refers only to iron and steel corrosion A very hard material aluminium oxide protects the aluminium from further corrosion In comparison to that when iron corrodes its color changes and produces large red flakes known as rust Unlike aluminium oxide the expanding and flaking of rust exposes new metal surface to further rusting772 Prevention of Corrosion7721 Removal of stains The regions of stains in an iron rod act as the site for corrosion If the surface of iron is properly cleaned and stains are removed it would prevent rusting7722 Paints and greasing Greasing or painting of the surface can prevent the rusting of iron With development of technologies modern paints contain a combination of chemicals called stabilizers that provide protection against the corrosion in addition to prevention against the weathering and other atmospheric effects7723 Alloying Alloy is a homogeneous mixture of one metal with one or more other metals or nonmetals Alloying of iron with other metals has proved to be very successful technique against rusting The best example of alloying is the stainless steel which is a good combination of iron chromium and nickel7724 Metallic coating The best method for protection against the corrosion of metals exposed to acidic conditions is coating the metal with other metal Corrosion resistant metals like Zn Sn and Cr are coated on the surface of iron to protect it from corrosion It is the most widely applied technique in the food industry where food is tinpacked The containers of iron are coated with tin to give it a longer life Metallic coating can take place by physical as well as electrolytic methods1 Physical Methods galvanizing and tin coatinga Zinc coating or Galvanizing The process of coating a thin layer of zinc on iron is called galvanizing This process is carried out by dipping a clean iron sheet in a zinc chloride bath and then heating it After this iron sheet is removed rolled into molten zinc metal bath and finally aircooled Advantage of galvanizing is that zinc protects the iron against corrosion even after the coating surface is brokenChemistry  IX 129Unit 7 Electrochemistryb Tin Coating It involves the dipping of the clean sheet of iron in a bath of molten tin and then passing it through hot rollers Such sheets are used in the beverage and food cans The tin protects the iron only as long as its protective layer remains intact Once it is broken and the iron is exposed to the air and water a galvanic cell is established and iron rusts rapidly 2 Electrolytic method Electroplating Electroplating is depositing of one metal over the other by means of electrolysis This process is used to protect metals against corrosion and to improve their appearance Principle of electroplating is to establish an electrolytic cell in which anode is made of the metal to be deposited and cathode of the object on which metal is to deposit The electrolyte is in aqueous solution of a salt of the respective metalProcedure for Electroplating In this process the object to be electroplated is cleaned with sand washed with caustic soda solution and finally it is thoroughly washed with water The anode is made of the metal which is to be deposited like Cr Ni The cathode is made up of the object that is to be electroplated like some sheet made up of iron The electrolyte in this system is a salt of the metal being deposited The electrolytic tank is made of cement glass or wood in which anode and cathode are suspended These electrodes are connected with a battery When the current is passed the metal from anode dissolves in the solution and metallic ions migrate to the cathode and discharge or deposit on the cathode object As a result of this discharge a thin layer of metal deposits on the object which is then pulled out and cleaned Some examples of electroplating are discussed herea Electroplating of Silver The electroplating of silver is carried out by establishing an electrolytic cell The pure piece of silver strip acts as anode that is dipped in silver nitrate solution The cathode is the metallic object to be coated such as spoon When the currentChemistry  IX 130Unit 7 Electrochemistryiiiiiiiv2v State the best method for protection of metal from corrosionviviiviiiixis passed through the cell the anode dissolves to produce Ag ions that migrate towards the cathode At cathode they are discharged and deposited on the object eg spoon The chemical reaction can be represented asFig 77 Electroplating of an object Common examples of silver plating are tablewares cutlery jewelry and steel objectsb Electroplating of Chromium The electroplating of chromium is carried out in the same way as that of silver The object to be electroplated is dipped in aqueous solution of chromium sulphate containing a little sulphuric acid that acts as an electrolyte The object to be electroplated acts as cathode while anode is made of antimonial lead The electrolyte ionizes and 3provides Cr ions which reduce and deposit at cathode Electrolyte produces the following ions Reactions at the electrodes are as follows For practical convenience the steel is usually plated first with nickel or copper and then by chromium because it does not adhere well on the steel surface Moreover it allows moisture to pass through it and metal is stripped off The nickel or copper provides adhesion and then chromium deposited over the adhesive layer of copper lasts longer This type of electroplating resists corrosion and gives a bright silvery appearance to the objectChemistry  IX 131Unit 7 ElectrochemistryCu SO 4c Electroplating of zinc The target metal is cleaned in alkaline detergent solutions and it is treated with acid in order to remove any rust or surface scales Then the zinc is deposited on the metal by immersing it in a chemical bath containing electrolyte zinc sulphate A current is applied which results in depositing of zinc on the target metal ie cathoded Electroplating of tin Tin is usually electroplated on steel by placing the steel into a container containing a solution of tin salt The steel is connected to an electrical circuit acting as cathode While the other electrode made of tin metal acts as anode When an electrical current passes through the circuit tin metal ions present in the solution deposit on steele Electrolytic refining of copper Impure copper is refined by the electrolytic method in the electrolytic cell Impure copper acts as anode and a pure copper plate acts as cathode as shown in figure 78 Copper sulphate solution in water is used as an electrolyte Oxidation reaction takes place at the anode Copper atoms from the impure copper lose electrons to the anode and dissolve in solution as copper ions Reduction reaction takes place at the cathode The copper ions present in the solution are attracted to the cathode Where they gain electrons from the cathode and become neutral and deposit on the cathode In the process impure copper is eaten away and purified copper atoms deposit on the cathodeChemistry  IX 132Unit 7 ElectrochemistryFig 78 Refining of copper in an electrolytic cellA OF OF Al O AND Fe O ON 2 3 2 Aluminium has a great tendency to corrosion However aluminium corrosion is aluminium oxide AI O  a very hard material that actually protects the aluminium from further 2 3 corrosion Aluminium oxide corrosion also looks a lot more like aluminium so it isnt as easy to notice as rusted iron When iron corrodes the color changes and it actually expands This expanding and color change can produce large red flakes that we all know as rust Unlike aluminium oxide the expanding and flaking of rust in iron exposes new metal to further rusting That is why it is so important to provide a barrier to stop OF In early nineteenth century photographers produced crude images using papers covered with silver nitrate or silver chloride The exposure of light on photographic plate initiated chemical reaction The light exposed portion became dark depending the amount or time of exposure That exposed plate was later on developed to show the image Those early days photographs darkened with time because of ongoing chemical reaction on them Later on procedures were developed to make the image permanent by use of mercury vapors followed by washing with sodium hyposulfite Na S O  It dissolved away the silver iodide from the 2 2 3unexposed portion of the plate and stopped the reaction further Although technologically more advanced the basic procedures developed originally are still used in all silverbased photography HOW AND CAN IN AND ON ARE OR Pure silver also called fine silver is relatively soft very malleable and easily damaged so it is commonly combined with other metals to produce a more durable product The most popular of these alloys is sterling silver which consists of 925 percent silver and 75 percent copper Although any metal can make up the 75 percent nonsilver portion of sterling centuries of experimentation have shown copper to be its best companion improving the metals hardness and durability without affecting its beautiful color The small amount of copper added to sterling has very little effect on the metals value Instead the price of the silver item is affected by the labour involved in making the item the skill of the craftsperson and the beauty of the design Care should also be taken to prevent silver tarnish in air a dulling that naturally occurs when silver reacts with sulfur or hydrogen sulfide in the ambient air Likewise the art of covering a metal with other metal is also used as silver

iii They have metallic bonding iv Chemistry  IX 139Unit 8 Chemical Reactivity811 Electropositive Character Metals have the tendency to lose their valance electrons This property of a metal is termed as electropositivity or metallic character The more easily a metal loses its electrons the more electropositive it is The number of electrons lost by an atom of a metal is called its valency For example sodium atom can lose 1 electron to form a positive ion So the valency of sodium metal is 1 Similarly zinc metal can lose 2 electrons from its valence shell Therefore its valency is 2Trends of electropositivity Electropositive character increases down the group because size of atoms increases For example lithium metal is less electropositive than sodium which is in turn less electropositive than potassium Electropositive character decreases across the period from left to right in the periodic table because atomic sizes decrease due to increase of nuclear charge It means elements at the start of a period are more metallic This character decreases as we move from left to right along the periodElectropositivity and ionization energy Electropositive character depends upon the ionization energy which in turn depends upon size and nuclear charge of the atom Small sized atoms with high nuclear charge have high ionization energy value In this way atoms having high ionization energy are less electropositive or metallic That is the reason alkali metals have the largest size and the lowest ionization energy in their respective periods Therefore they have the highest metallic character For example a comparison of sodium and magnesium metals is given below for understandingChemistry  IX 140Unit 8 Chemical ReactivityThe most abundant metal is aluminiumThe most precious metal is platinumThe most useable metal is ironThe most reactive metal is cesiumThe most valuable metal is uranium3The lightest metal is lithium d  053 g cm 3The heaviest metal is osmium d  225 g cm The least conductor of heat is leadThe best conductor metals are silver and goldThe most ductile and malleable metals are gold and silverst nd The 1 ionization energy of magnesium is high but the 2 ionization energy of magnesium is very high It becomes very difficult to remove second electron from the Mg ion as nuclear charge attracts the remaining electrons strongly As a result of this attraction size of the ion decreases Similarly all the elements of alkaline earth metals have high ionization energies as compared to alkali metals as shown in table 81Table 81 Atomic Number Electronic Configurations

Comparison of Physical Properties of Alkali and Alkaline EarthMetals The elements in first two groups of the periodic table Group 1 and Group 2 are called ‘Alkali ’ and ‘Alkaline earth’ metals respectively Alkali metals are extremely 1 reactive elements because of their nsvalence shell electronic configuration As there is only one electron in their valence shell it can be easily given out It is the reason that they are always found in nature as cations with 1 oxidation state Therefore they readily form salts with nonmetals The alkaline earth metals atoms are smaller and have more nuclear charge They 2have two electrons in their valence shells ie ns They are also reactive but less than alkali metalsChemistry  IX 142Unit 8 Chemical Reactivity160 72 186 1028392Na  H 2NaH A

variety of oxidation states Figure 82 shows transition metals of 4th 5th and the 6th period of the periodic table There are three series of transition elements each series consisting of ten elementsFig 82 The Transition Elements in the Periodic Table Chemical behaviour of the first transition series is similar to active metals except copper Three transition metals belonging to group 11 are copper silver and gold Out of them gold and silver are relatively inactive metals because they do not lose electrons easily Silver is white lustrous metal It is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity It is also highly ductile and malleable metal Its polished surfaces are good reflectors of light Formation of thin layer of oxide or sulphide on its surface makes it relatively unreactive Under normal conditions of atmosphere air does not affectChemistry  IX 144Unit 8 Chemical Reactivitysilver It tarnishes in presence of sulphur containing compounds like H S2 Being very soft metal it is rarely used as such Alloys of silver with copper are widely used in making coins silverware and ornaments Compounds of silver are widely used in photographic films and dental preparations Silver also has important applications in mirror industry Gold is a yellow soft metal It is most malleable and ductile of all the metals One gram of gold can be drawn into a wire of one and a half kilometre long Gold is very nonreactive or inert metal It is not affected by atmosphere It is not even affected by any single mineral acid or base Because of its inertness in atmosphere it is an ornamental metal as well as used in making coins Gold is too soft to be used as such It is always alloyed with copper silver or some other metal Platinum is used to make jewelry items because of its unique characteristics like colour beauty strength flexibility and resistance to tarnish It provides a secure setting for diamonds and other gemstones enhancing their brilliance An alloy of platinum palladium and rhodium is used as catalyst in automobiles as catalytic converter It converts most of the toxic gases CO NO  being emitted by 2vehicles into less harmful carbon dioxide nitrogen and water vapour Platinum is used in the production of hard disk drive coatings and fibre optic cables Platinum is used in the manufacturing of fibre glass reinforced plastic and glass for liquid crystal displays LCD82 Nonmetals form negative ions anions by gaining electrons In this way nonmetals are electronegative in nature and form acidic oxides The valency of some nonmetals depend upon the number of electrons accepted by them For example valency of chlorine atom is 1 as it accepts only 1 electron in its outermost shellChemistry  IX 145Unit 8 Chemical ReactivityPurity of gold is shown by carats that indicates the number of parts by weight of gold that is present in 24 parts of alloy Twenty four carat gold is pure 22 carats gold means that 22 parts pure gold is alloyed with 2 parts of either silver or copper for making ornaments and jewelry White gold is its alloy with palladium nickel or zinciiiiiiivvviviiSimilarly oxygen atom can accept 2 electrons therefore its valency is 2 The nonmetallic character depends upon the electron affinity and electronegativity of the atom Small sized elements having high nuclear charge are electronegative in nature They have high electron affinity Therefore they possess nonmetallic character Hence nonmetallic character decreases in a group downward and increases in a period from left to right up to halogens Fluorine is the most nonmetallic element The nonmetals are therefore elements in Group14Carbon Group15 nitrogen and phosphorus Group16 oxygen sulphur and selenium and in Group17 halogens fluorine chorine bromine and iodine of the periodic table Figure 83 shows position of nonmetals in the periodic tableImportant physical properties of nonmetals are as follows Physical properties of nonmetals change gradually but uniquely in a group of nonmetals Nonmetals usually exist in all three physical states of matter The nonmetals at the top of the group are usually gases while others are either liquids or solids Solids nonmetals are brittle break easily i Nonmetals are bad conductors of heat and ii electricity except graphite They are not shiny they are dull except iii iodine it is lustrous like metals They are generally soft except diamond iv They have low melting and boiling points v except silicon graphite and diamond They have low densities vi Important chemical properties of nonmetals are as follows Their valence shells are deficient of electrons therefore they readily i accept electrons to complete their valence shells and become stable They form ionic compounds with metals and covalent compounds by ii reacting with other nonmetals eg CO  NO  etc2 2 Nonmetals usually do not react with water iii They do not react with dilute acids because nonmetals are itself electron iv

decreasing trend of electronegativity is shown below821 Comparison of Reactivity of the Halogens Elements of Group17 of the periodic table consist of fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine They are collectively called halogens Fluorine and chlorine exist as diatomic gases at room temperature Interestingly the intermolecular forces of attraction increase downward in the group due to the increase in the size of atom Due to this reason bromine exists as a liquid and iodine as solid Some physical properties of halogens are shown in Table 84Table 84 Some Physical Characteristics of Halogens2 5 In general their valence shell electronic configuration is ns np Since halogens have only one electron deficit in their valence shell either they can readily accept an electron from a metal or they can share an electron with other nonmetals Thus halogens form ionic bonds with metals and covalent bond with nonmetals822 Important Reactions of Halogens1 Oxidizing properties All halogens are oxidizing agents Fluorine is the strongest oxidizing element while iodine is the least ie is mild oxidizing agent Fluorine will oxidize any of halide ion X  in solution and changes itself to F ion Similarly chlorine will displace Br and I ion s from their salt solutions and oxidize them to bromine and iodine Solution turns from colourless to reddish brownSimilarlyChemistry  IX 147 Unit
