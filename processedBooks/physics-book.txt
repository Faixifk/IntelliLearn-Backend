the various branches of physics Man has always been inspired by the wonders of nature He has always been curious to know the secrets of nature and remained in search of the truth and reality He observes various phenomena and tries to find their answers by logical reasoning The knowledge gained through observations andexperimentations is called Science  The word science is derived from the Latin word scientia  which means knowledge  Not until eighteenth century various aspect of material objects were studied under a single subject called natural philosophy  But as the knowledge increased  it was divided into two main streams Physical sciences — which deal with the study of nonliving things and Biological sciences — which are concerned with the study of living things Measurements are not confined to science  They are part of our lives They play an important role to describe and understand the physical world  Over the centuries  man has improved the methods of measurements  In this unit we will study some of physical quantities and a few useful measuring instruments  We will also learn the measuring techniques that enable us to measure various quantities accurately 11 TO the nineteenth century physical sciences were divided into five distinct disciplines  physics  chemistry astronomy  geology and meteorology  The most fundamental of these is the Physics In Physics we study matter energy and their interaction  The laws and principles of Physics help us to understand nature The rapid progress in science during the recent years has become possible due to the discoveries and inventions in the field of Physics The technologies are the applications of scientific principles  Most of the technologies of our modern society throughout the world are related to Physics For example  a car is made on the principles of mechanics and a refrigerator is based on the principles of thermodynamics In our daily life we hardly find a device where Physics is not involved  Consider pulleys that make it easy to lift heavy loads  Electricity is used not only OF It is the study of motion of objects its causes and effectsHeatIt deals with the nature of heat modes of transfer and effects of heatSound It deals with the physical aspects of sound waves their production  properties and applications Light OpticsIt is the study of physical aspects of

electric motors etc Consider the means of transportation such as car and aeroplanes  domestic appliances such as airconditioners  refrigerators  vacuum cleaners  washing machines  and microwave ovens etc Similarly the means of communication such as radio  TV telephone and computer are the result of applications of Physics These devices have made our lives much easier  faster and more comfortable than the past It allows us to contact people anywhere in the world and to get latest worldwide information  We can take and save pictures send and receive messages of our friends We can also receive radio transmission and can use it as a calculator as well However  the scientific inventions have also caused harms and destruction of serious nature One of which is the environmental pollution and the other is the deadly weapons 12 All measurable quantities are called physical quantities such as length mass time and temperature A physical quantity possesses at least two characteristics in common One is its numerical magnitude and the other is the unit in which it is measured For example if the length of a student is 104 cm then 104 is its numerical magnitude and centimetre is the unit of measurement Similarly when a grocer says that each bag contains 5 kg sugar he is describing its numerical magnitude as well as the unit of measurement It would be meaningless to state 5 or kg only Physical quantities are divided into base quantities and derived quantities4 Unit 1 Physical Quantities and Measurement Physics IXVolume31 cm1 mL1 cm 10 cm 1 There are seven physical quantities which form the foundation for other physical quantities These physical quantities are called the base quantities These are length mass time electric current temperature intensity of light and the amount of a physical quantities which are expressed in terms of base quantities are called the derived quantities These include area volume speed force work energy power electric charge electric potential etc13 OF is not simply counting For example if we need milk or sugar we must also understand how much quantity of milk or sugar we are talking about Thus there is a need of some standard quantities for measuringcomparing unknown quantities Once a standard is set for a quantity then it can be expressed in terms of that standard quantity This standard quantity is called a unitWith the developments in the field of science and technology the need for a commonly acceptable system of units was seriously felt all over the world particularly to exchange scientific and technical information The eleventh General Conference on Weight and Measures held in Paris in 1960 adopted a worldwide system of measurements called International System of Units The International System of Units is commonly referred as units that describe base quantities are called base units Each base quantity has its SI unitBase quantities are the quantities on the basis of which other quantities are expressedThe quantities that are expressed in terms of base quantities are called derived quantitiesVolume is a derived quantity 1 L  1000 mL 3 1 L  1 dm 3 10 cm 3  1000 cm 31 mL  1 cm3Express 1m in litres  L5 Unit 1 Physical Quantities and Measurement Physics IXTable 11 shows seven base quantities their SI units and their symbolsTable 11 Base quantities their SI units with units used to measure derived quantities are called derived units Derived units are defined in terms of base units and are obtained by multiplying or dividing one or more base units with each other The 2 3 unit of area metre and the unit of volume metreare based on the unit of length which is metre Thus the unit of length is the base unit while the unit of area and volume are derived units Speed is defined as distance covered in unit time therefore its unit is metre per second In the same way the unit of density force pressure power etc can be derived using one or more base units Some derived units and their symbols are given in the Table 12Table 12 Derived quantities and their SI units with symbols6 Unit 1 Physical Quantities and Measurement Physics IX14 of the quantities are either very large or very small For example 250 000 m 0002 W and 0000 002 g etc SI units have the advantage that their multiples and submultiples can be expressed in terms of prefixes Prefixes are the words or letters added before SI units such as kilo mega giga and milli These prefixes are given in Table 13 The prefixes are useful to express very large or small quantities For example divide 20000 g by 1000 to express it into kilogramme since kilo 3represents 10 or Identify the base quantity in the followingi Speed ii Area iii Force iv Distance3 Identify the following as base or derived quantitydensity force mass speed time lengthtemperature and volumeTable 14 shows some multiples and submultiples of length However double prefixes are not used For example no prefix is used with kilogramme since it already contains the prefix kilo Prefixes given in Table 13 are used with both types base and derived units Let us consider few more examples1 3 1 1I 200 000 ms  200x10 ms 200kms3ii 4 800 000 W  4 800x10 W 4 800 kW6

metres away from the Earth Distance of the moon from the Earth can also be 8expressed as 384 x10 m This form of expressing a number is called the standard form or scientific notation  This saves writing down or interpreting large numbers of zeros ThusIn scientific notation a number is expressed as some power of ten multiplied by a number between 1 and 10For example  a number 62750 can be 3 4 5expressed as 6275x10 or 6275x10 or 06275x10  All these are correct But the number that has one nonzero 4digit before the decimal ie 6275x10 preferably be taken as the standard form Similarly the standard form of 4000045 s is 45x10 s1 Name five prefixes most commonly used2 The Sun is one hundred and fifty million kilometres away from the Earth Write this a as an ordinary whole number b in

measure length of an object or distance between two points  It is one metre long which is equal to 100 centimetres  Each centimetre cm is divided into 10 small divisions called millimetre mm Thus one millimetre is the smallest reading that can be taken using a metre rule and is called its least countWhile measuring length  or distance  eye must be kept vertically above the reading point as shown in figure 14b The reading becomes doubtful if the eye is positioned either left or right to the reading point THE Measuring tapes are used to measure length in metres and centimetres  Figure 15 shows a measuring tape used by blacksmith and carpenters  A measuring tape consists of a thin and long strip of cotton metal or plastic generally 10 m 20 m 50 m or 100 m long Measuring tapes are marked in centimetres as well as in inches 16 instruments are used to measure various physical quantities such as length  mass time volume  etc Measuring instruments used in the past were not so reliable and accurate as we use today For example  sundial  water clock and other time measuring devices used around 1300 AD were quite crude  On the other hand  digital clocks and watches used nowadays are highly reliable and accurate  Here we shall describe some measuring instruments used in Physics laboratory THE 13 A metre ruleFigure 14 Wrong position of theeye to note the readingb Correct position of the

Physics IXWorking of a Vernier Callipers First of all find the error if any in the measuring instrument It is called the zero error of the instrument Knowing the zero error necessary correction can be made to find the correct measurement Such a correction is called zero correction of the instrument Zero correction is the negative of zero errorMain Scale Outer jawsVernier Scale 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Callipers A Vernier Callipers consists of two jaws as shown in figure 16 One is a fixed jaw with main scale attached to it Main scale has centimetre and millimetre marks on it The other jaw is a moveable jaw It has vernier scale having 10 divisions over it such that each of its division is 09 mm The difference between one small division on main scale division and one vernier scale division is 01 mm It is called least count LC of the Vernier Callipers Least count of the Vernier Callipers can also be found as given belowFigure 16 A Vernier Callipers with jaws closedHenceMini ExerciseCut a

cylinder displaced or rotated each timeZero Error and Zero CorrectionTo find the zero error close the jaws of Vernier Callipers gently If zero line of the vernier scale coincides with the zero of the main scale then the zero error is zero figure 17a Zero error will exist if zero line of the vernier scale is not coinciding with the zero of main scale figure 17b Zero error will be positive if zero line of vernier scale is on the right side of the zero of the main scale and will be negative if zero line of vernier scale is on the left side of zero of the main scale figure 17cTaking a Reading on

as micrometer screw gauge  A simple screw gauge consists of a Ushaped metal frame with a metal stud at its one end as shown in figure 19 A hollow cylinder or sleeve  has a millimetre scale over it along a line called index line parallel to its axis The hollow cylinder acts as a nut It is fixed at the end of Ushaped frame opposite to the stud A Thimble has a threaded spindle inside it As the thimble completes one rotation  the spindle moves 1 mm along the index line It is because the distance between consecutive threads on the spindle is 1 mm This distance is called the pitch of screw on the spindle  The thimble has 100 divisions around its one end It is the circular scale of the screw gauge  As thimble completes one rotation  100 divisions pass the index line and the thimble moves 1 mm along the main scale  Thus each division of circular scale crossing the index line moves the thimble through 1100 mm or 001 mm on the main scale  Least count of a screw gauge can also be found as given below Figure 19 A micrometer screw gauge13 Unit 1 Physical Quantities and Measurement Physics IX 0 50959085Zero error is negative if zero of circular scale has passed zero of main scale Here zero error is –005 mm as 5 divisions of circular scale has crossed the index line 0 10509590As zero of circular scale is exactly on the index line hence there is no zero error 0 3025201510Zero error

screw gauge is 001 mm or 0001 OF A The first step is to find the zero error of the screw find the zero error close the gap between the spindle and the stud of the screw gauge by rotating the ratchet in the clockwise direction If zero of circular scale coincides with the index line then the zero error will be zero as shown in figure 110aZero error will be positive if zero of circular scale is behind the index line In this case multiply the number of divisions of the circular scale that has not crossed the index line with the least count of screw gauge to find zero error as shown in figure 110bZero error will be negative if zero of circular scale has crossed the index line In this case multiply the number of divisions of the circular scale that has crossed the index line with the least count of screw gauge to find the negative zero error as shown in figure 12Find the diameter of a wire using a screw diameter of a given wire can be found asfollowsi Close the gap between the spindle

world in the ancient times However  balances were also in use by Greeks and Romans  Beam balances such as shown in figure 113 are still in use at many places  In a beam balance  the unknown mass is placed in one pan It is balanced by putting known masses in the other pan Today people use many types of mechanical and electronic balances  You might have seen electronic balances in sweet and grocery shops  These are more precise than beam balances and are easy to A physical balance is used in the laboratory to measure the mass of various objects by comparison  It consists of a beam

to zero by varying standard massesFigure 115 A lever extinguisher17 Unit 1 Physical Quantities and Measurement Physics balances such as shown in figure 116 come in various ranges  milligram ranges  gram ranges and kilogramme ranges  Before measuring the mass of a body  it is switched ON and its reading is set to zero Next place the object to be weighed  The reading on the balance gives you the mass of the body placed over itThe most Accurate BalanceThe mass of one rupee coin is done using different balances as given below a Beam BalanceLet the balance measures coin s mass  32 gA sensitive beam balance may be able to detect a change as small as of 01 g Or 100 mgb Physical BalanceLet the balance measures coin s mass  324 gLeast count of the physical balance may be as small as 001 g or 10 mg Therefore  its measurement would be more precise than a sensitive beam balance c Electronic BalanceLet the balance measures coin s mass  3247 gLeast count of an electronic balance is 0001 g or 1 mg Therefore  its measurement would be more precise than a sensitive physical balance  Thus electronic balance is the most sensitive balance in the above balances stopwatch is used to measure the time interval of an event There are two types of stopwatches  mechanical and digital as shown in figure 117 and 118 A mechanical stopwatch can measure a time interval up to a minimum 01 second  Digital stopwatches commonly used in laboratories can measure a time interval as small as 1100 second or 001 second PanGlass precision of a balance in measuring mass of an object is different for different balances  A sensitive balance cannot measure large masses Similarly a balance that measures large masses cannot be sensitive Some digital balances m e a s u r e e v e n s m a l l e r difference of the

StopwatchA mechanical stopwatch has a knob that is used to wind the spring that powers the watch It can also be used as a startstop and reset button The watch starts when the knob is pressed once When pressed second time it stops the watch while the third press brings the needle back to zero position The digital stopwatch starts to indicate the time lapsed as the startstop button is pressed  As

glass or transparent plastic cylinder  It has a scale along its length that indicates the volume in millilitre mL as shown in figure 119 Measuring cylinders have different capacities from 100 mL to 2500 mL They are used to measure the volume of a liquid or powdered substance  It is also used to find the volume of an irregular shaped solid insoluble in a liquid by displacement method The solid is lowered into a measuring cylinder containing waterliquid  The level of waterliquid rises The increase in the volume of waterliquid is the volume of the given solid objectFigure 119a Wrong way to note

measuring cylinder  it must be kept vertical on a plane surface Take a measuring cylinder  Place it vertically on the table  Pour some water into it Note that the surface of water is curved as shown in figure 119 The meniscus of the most liquids curve downwards while the meniscus of mercury curves upwards  The correct method to note the level of a liquid in the cylinder is to keep the eye at the same level as the meniscus of the liquid as shown in figure 119b It is incorrect to note the liquid level keeping the eye above the level of liquid as shown in figure 119 a When the eye is above the liquid level the meniscus appears higher on the scale  Similarly when the eye is below the liquid level the meniscus appears lower than actual height of the liquid OF AN cylinder can be used to find

quantity is expressed by a number followed by some suitable unit Every measurement of a quantity is an attempt to find its true value  The accuracy in measuring a physical quantity depends upon various factors  the quality of the measuring instrument the skill of the observer the number of observations madeFor example  a student measures the length of a book as 18 cm using a measuring tape

mishap or accident  For your own safety and for the safety of others in the laboratory  follow safety rules given below Do not carry out any experiment without the permission of your teacherDo not eat

figures 1 and 8 aresignificant  To write the quantity in scientificnotation  we move the decimal point twoplaces to the left thus21008 s  1008 x10 sb The first two zeros are not significant  They are used to space the decimal point  The digit 58 and the final zero are significant  Thus there are three significant figures  In scientific notation  it can be 3written as 580x10 kmc The final zero is significant since it comes after the decimal point  The zero between last zero and 1 is also significant because it comes between the significant figures  Thus the number of significant figures in this case is four In scientific notation  it can be written as22100 g  2100 x 10 gRounding the Numbersi lf the last digit is less than 5 then it is simply dropped  This decreases the number of significant digits in the figureFor example 1943 is rounded to 194 3 significant figureii If the last digit is greaterthan 5 then the digit onits left is increased byone This also decreasesthe number

measure the average speed of a 100 m sprinterThe students will be able to list the effects of various means of transportation and their safety issues the use of mathematical slopes ramps of graphs or straight lines in real life applications interpret graph from newspaper magazine regarding cricket and weather etcThe first thing concerning the motion of an object is its kinematics Kinematics is the study of motion of an object without discussing the cause of motion In this unit we will study the types of motion scalar and vector quantities the relation between displacement speed velocity and acceleration linear motion and equations of AND Concepts21 Rest and motion22 Types of motion Translator rotatory vibratory23 Terms associated with motion • Position • Distance and displacement • Speed

Unit 2 Kinematics Physics IX21 AND see various things around us Some of them are at rest while others are in motionThe state of rest or motion of a body is relative  For example  a passenger sitting in a moving bus is at rest because heshe is not changing hisher position with respect to other passengers or objects in the bus But to an observer outside the bus the passengers and the objects inside the bus are in motion 22 OF we observe carefully  we will find that everything in the universe is in motion  However  different objects move differently Some objects move along a straight line some move in a curved path and some move in some other way There are three types of motion I Translatory motion linear  random andcircular  ii Rotatory motion iii Vibratory motion to and fro motion how various objects are moving A car moving in a straight line has translational motion  Similarly  an aeroplane moving straight is in translational motion Surroundings are the places in its neighbourhood where various objects are present Similarly A body is said to be at rest if it does not change its position with respect to its surroundings A body is said to be in motion if it changes its position with respect to its surroundings In translational motion a body moves along a line without any rotation The line may be straight or curvedFigure 21 The passengers in the bus are also moving with itFigure 2 A car and an aeroplane moving along a straight line are in linear motionFigure 23 Translatory motion of an object along a curved pathFigure 24 Translatory motion of riders in Ferris wheel30 Unit 2 Kinematics Physics IXThe object as shown in figure 23 moves along a curved path without rotation This is the translational motion of the object Riders moving in a Ferris wheel such as shown in figure 24 are also in translational motion Their motion is in a circle without rotation Translatory motions can be divided into linear motion circular motion and random come across many objects which are moving in a straight line The motion of objects such as a car moving on a straight and level road is linear motionStraight line motion of a body is known as its linear motionAeroplanes flying straight in air and objects falling vertically down are also the examples of linear stone tied at the end of a string can be made to whirl The stone as shown in figure 26 moves in a circle and thus has circular motionThe motion of an object in a circular path is known as circular motionFigure 27 shows a toy train moving on a circular track A bicycle or a car moving along a circular track possesses circular motion Motion of the Earth around the Sun and motion of the moon around the Earth are also the examples of circular motionsFigure 25 Linear motion of the ball falling downFigure 26 A stone tied at the end of a string moves in a circleFigure 27 A toy train moving on a circular track31 Unit 2 Kinematics Physics IXFigure 28 Random motion of gas molecules is called Brownian motionFigure 2 Their movements are irregularThe disordered or irregular motion of an object is called random motionThus motion of insects and birds is random motion The motion of dust or smoke particles in the air is also random motion The Brownian motion of a gas or liquid molecules along a zigzag path such as shown in figure 28 is also an example of random the motion of a top It is spinning about an axis Particles of the spinning top move in circles and thus individual particles possess circular motionThe top shown in figure 29 spins about its axis passing through it and thus it possesses rotatory motion An axis is a line around which a body rotates In circular motion the point about which a body goes around is outside the body In rotatory motion the line around which a body moves about is passing through the body itselfThe spinning motion of a body about its axis is called its rotatory motionThe motion of a wheel about its axis and that of a steering wheel are the examples of rotatory motion The motion of the Earth around the Sun is circular motion and not the spinning motion However the motion of the Earth about its geographic axis that causes day and night is rotatory motion Think of some more examples of rotatory motion32 Unit 2 Kinematics Physics a baby in a swing as shown in figure 210 As it is pushed  the swing moves back and forth about its mean position  The motion of the baby repeats from one extreme to the other extreme with the swing To and fro motion of a body about its mean position is known as vibratory motionFigure 211 shows to and fro motion of the pendulum of a clock about its mean position  it is called vibratory motion  We can find many examples of vibratory motion around us Look at the children in a seesaw as shown in figure 212Figure 212 Vibratory motion of children in a seesaw A baby in a cradle moving to and fro to and fro motion of the hammer of a ringing electric bell and the motion of the string of a sitar are some of the examples of vibratory motion Figure211 Vibratory motion of the pendulum of a clockFigure210 Vibratory motion of a child and a swing Mini Exercise12 Give an example of a body that is at rest and is in motion at the same time3 Mention the type of motion in each of the followingi A ball moving vertically upward ii A child moving down a slideiii Movement of a player in a football ground iv The flight of a butterflyv An athlete running in a circular trackvi The motion of a wheel vii The motion of a cradle  a F2 F1 F2b F1 33 Unit 2 Kinematics Physics IX23 AND Physics we come across various quantities such as mass length volume density speed and force etc We divide them into scalars and physical quantity which can be completely described by its magnitude is called a scalar The magnitude of a quantity means its numerical value with an appropriate unit such as 25 kg 40 s 18 m etc Examples of scalars are mass length time speed volume work and energyA scalar quantity is described completely by its magnitude vector can be described completely by magnitude alongwith its direction Examples of vectors are velocity displacement force momentum torque etc It would be meaningless to describe vectors without direction For example distance of a place from reference point is insufficient to locate that place The direction of that place from reference point is also necessary to locate it A vector quantity is described completely by magnitude and directionConsider a table as shown in figure 213 a Two forces F and F are acting on it Does it make any 1 2difference if the two forces act in opposite direction such as indicated in figure 2Certainly the two situations differ from each other They differ due to the direction of the forces acting on the table Thus the description of a force would be incomplete if direction is not given Similarly when we say we are 1 walking at the rate of 3 kmh towards north then we are talking about a vectorFigure 213 Two forces F and 1 F a both acting in the same 2direction b acting in opposite directions V A34 Unit 2 Kinematics Physics IX To differentiate a vector from a scalar quantity we generally use bold letters to represent vector quantities such as F a d or a bar or arrow over theirsymbols such as F a d or F  a and d Graphically a vector can be represented by a line segment with an arrow head In figure 214 the line AB with arrow head at B represents a vector V The length of the line AB gives the magnitude of the vector V on a selected scale While the direction of the line from A to B gives the direction of the vector 21Represent a force of 80 N acting toward North of Draw two lines perpendicular to each other Horizontal line represents EastWest and vertical line represents NorthSouth direction as shown in figure 215Step2 Select a suitable scale to represent the given vector In this case we may take a scale which represents 20 N by 1 cm lineStep3 Draw a line according to the scale in the direction of the vector In this case draw a line OA of length 4 cm along NorthEastStep4 Put an arrow head at the end of the line In this case arrow head is at point A Thus the line OA will represent a vector ie the force of 80 N acting towards NorthEast24 When dealing with motion we come across various terms such as the position of an object the distance covered by it its speed and so on Let us explain some of the terms usedFigure 214 Graphicalrepresentation of a vector VSH35 Unit 2 Kinematics Physics IXThe term position describes the location of a place or a point with respect to some reference point called origin For example you want to describe the position of your school from your home Let the school be represented by S and home by H The position of your school from your home will be represented by a straight line HS in the direction from H to S as shown in figure AND 217 shows a curved path Let S be the length of the curved path between two points A and B on it Then S is the distance between points A and BLength of a path between two points is called the distance between those pointsConsider a body that moves from point A to point B along the curved path Join points A and B by a straight line The straight line AB gives the distance which is the shortest between A and B This shortest distance has magnitude d and direction from point A to B This shortest distance d in a particular direction is called displacement It is a vector quantity and is represented by dDisplacement is the shortest distance between two points which has magnitude and directionSpeed of an object is the rate at which it is moving In other words the distance moved by an object in unit time is its speed This unit time may be a second an hour a day or a yearThe distance covered by an object in unit time is called its speedFalcon can fly at a 1speed of 200 kmhFigure 217 Distance S dotted line and displacement d red line from points A to BFigure 216 Position of the school S from the home Here S is the distance covered by the object v is its speed and t is the time taken by it Distance is a scalar therefore speed is also a scalar SI unit of speed is metre 1per second ms equation 21 v is the average speed of a body during time f It is because the speed of the body may be changing during the time interval t However if the speed of a body does not vary and has the same value then the body is said to possess uniform speedA body has uniform speed if it covers equal distances in equal intervals of time however short the interval may velocity tells us not only the speed of a body but also the direction along which the body is moving Velocity of a body is a vector quantity It is equal to the displacement of a body in unit timeThe rate of displacement of a body is called its velocity Here d is the displacement of the body moving with velocity v in time t SI unit of velocity is the same as 1speed ie metre per second ms equation 22 v is the average velocity of a body during time t It is because the velocity of theDistance  speed x timeor Cheetah can run at a 1speed of 70 kmh A motorway speed cameraA gun is light detection and ranging speed gun It uses the time taken by laser pulse to make a series of measurements of a vehicles distance from the gun The data is then used to calculate the vehicles speedA paratrooper attains a uniform velocity called terminal velocity with

time interval t However in many cases the speed and direction of a body does not change In such a case the body possesses uniform velocity That is the velocity of a body during any interval of time has the same magnitude and direction ThusA body has uniform velocity if it covers equal displacement in equal intervals of time however short the interval may 22A sprinter completes its 100 metre race

IX velocity decreasing velocity increasing Acceleration due to gravity 1Thus speed of the cyclist is 111 ms along the 1track and its velocity is about 71 ms along the diameter AB of the trackIn many cases the velocity of a body changes due to a change either in its magnitude or direction or both The change in the velocity of a body causes acceleration in itAcceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity of a bodyTaking acceleration as a initial velocity as V  final ivelocity as v and t is the time interval SI unit of f2acceleration is metre per second per second ms average acceleration of a body given by equation 23 is a during time t Let the time t is divided into many smaller intervals of time If the rate of change of velocity during all these intervals remains constant then the acceleration a also remains constant Such a body is said to possess uniform accelerationA body has uniform acceleration if it has equal changes in velocity in equal intervals of time however short the interval may be38 Unit 2 Kinematics Physics of a moving object is in the direction of velocity if its velocity is increasing Acceleration of the object is opposite to the direction of velocity if its velocity is decreasing39 Unit 2 Kinematics Physics IXInitial velocityFinal velocityTime taken t2Thus the acceleration of the car is 25 msAcceleration of a body is positive if its velocity increases with time The direction of this acceleration is the same in which the body is moving without change in its direction Acceleration of a body is negative if velocity of the body decreases The direction of negative acceleration is opposite to the direction in which the body is moving Negative acceleration is also called deceleration or 24A car starts from rest Its velocity

of the quantities is called the independent quantity and the other quantity the value of which varies with the independent quantity is called the dependent is useful to represent the motion of objects using graphs The terms distance and displacement are used interchangeably when the motion is in a straight line Similarly if the motion is in a straight line then speed and velocity are also used interchangeably In a distancetime graph time is taken along horizontal axis while vertical axis shows the distance covered by the AT the graph shown in figure 218 the distance moved by the object with time is zero That is the object is at rest Thus a horizontal line parallel to time axis on a distancetime graph shows that speed of the object is speed of an object is said to be constant if it covers equal distances in equal intervals of time The distancetime graph as shown in figure 219 is a straight line Its slope gives the speed of the object Consider two points A and B on the

all the freely falling objects have the same acceleration independent of their masses He dropped various objects of different masses from the leaning tower of Pisa He found that all of them reach the ground at the same time The acceleration of freely falling bodies is called gravitational acceleration It is denoted by g On the surface of the Earth its value is approximately 210 ms  For bodies

studied the changes in motion only Our understanding about the changes in motion is of little value without knowing its causes The branch of mechanics that deals with the study of motion of an object and the cause of its motion is called dynamics In this unit we shall study momentum and investigate what causes a change in the motion of a body and what role the mass of a body plays in its motion This inquiry leads us to the concept of force We shall also study the laws of motion and their applications31 AND laws of motion are of fundamental importance in understanding the causes of motion of a body Before we discuss these laws it is appropriate to understand various terms such as force inertia and can open a door either by pushing or pulling it Figure 31 shows a man pushing a cart The push may move the cart or change the direction of its motion or may stop the moving cart A batsman in figure 32 is changing the direction of a moving ball by pushing it with his batA force may not always cause a body to move Look at the picture shown in figure 33 A boy is pushing a wall and is thus trying to move it A Goalkeeper needs a force to stop a ball coming to him as shown in figure 34 Thus we understand thatFigure 32 Ball is turned into different direction as it is pushed by the batsmanFigure 33 A boy is pushing the wallFigure 34 Goalkeeper is stopping the ballUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 58A force moves or tends to move stops or tends to stop the motion of a body  The force can also change the direction of motion of a body You can cut an apple with a knife by pushing its sharp edge into the apple  Thus a force can also change the shape or size of a body on which it observed that it is easy to move or to stop light objects than heavier ones  Heavier objects are difficult to move or if moving then difficult to stop Newton concluded that everybody resists to the change in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line He called this property of matter as inertia  He related the inertia of a body with its mass greater is the mass of a body greater is its inertia Inertia of a body is its property due to which it resists any change in its state of rest or motion Let us perform an experiment to understand inertia 31Take a glass and cover it with a piece of cardboard  Place a coin on the cardboard as shown in figure 35 Now flick the card horizontally with a jerk of your finger The coin does not move with the cardboard due to inertia Consider another example of inertia  Cut a strip of paper  Place it on the table  Stack a few coins at its one end as shown in figure 36 Pull out the paper strip under the coins with a jerkFigure 35 The coin fails into the glass as the card flicks awayFigure 36 Coins stacked over remain undisturbed on pulling  the paper strip quicklyUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX bullet has a very small inertia due to its small massOn the other hand  the impact of a loaded truck on a body coming its way is very large even if the truck is moving slowly  To explain such situation  we define a new physical quantity called momentum  Momentum of a body is the quantity of motion it possesses due to its mass and velocityThe momentum P of a body is given by the product of its mass m and velocity v Thus P  mv      31Momentum is a vector quantity  Its SI unit is 1kgms 32 OF Newton was the first to formulate the laws of motion known as Newton s laws of motion LAW OF First law of motion deals with bodies which are either at rest or moving with uniform speed in a straight line According to Newton s first law of motion  a body at rest remains at rest provided no net force acts on it This part of the law is true as we observe that objects do not move by themselves unless someone moves them For example  a book lying on a table remains at rest as long as no net force acts on it Similarly  a moving object does not stop moving by itself A ball rolled on a rough ground stops earlier than that rolled on a smooth ground  It is because rough surfaces offer greater friction If there would be no force to oppose the motion of a body then the moving body would never stop Thus Newton s first law of motion states that A body continues its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line provided no net force acts on itNet force is the resultant of all the forces acting on a bodyand ororSince Newtons first law of motion deals with the inertial property of matter therefore Newtons first law of motion is also known as law of inertiaWe have observed that the passengers standing in a bus fall forward when its driver applies brakes suddenly It is because the upper parts of their bodies tend to continue their motion while lower parts of their bodies in contact with the bus stop with it Hence they fall LAW OF second law of motion deals with situations when a net force is acting on a body It states that When a net force acts on a body it produces acceleration in the body in the direction of the net force The magnitude of this acceleration is directly proportional to the net force acting on the body and inversely proportional to its massIf a force produces an acceleration a in a body of mass m then we can state mathematically thatPutting k as proportionality constant we getIn SI units the value of k comes out to be 1 Thus Eq 32 becomesSI unit of force is newton N According to Newtons second law of motion One newton 1 N is the force that produces an 2acceleration of 1 ms in a body of mass of 1 kg Thus a force of one newton can be expressed asWhen a bus takes a sharp turn passengers fall in the outward direction It is due to inertia that they want to continue their motion in a straight line and thus fall outwardsUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 60Hereusing the 31Find the acceleration that is produced by a 20 N force in a mass of 8 acceleration produced by the force is 25 ms 32 A force acting on a body of mass 5 kg produces 2an acceleration of 10 Newton’s second law of motion we getComparing the equations we getorUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 61012345678910NBlock 1 newtonSpring balance2 Hence the acceleration produced is 625 ms 33 A cyclist of mass 40 kg exerts a force of 200 N to move 2his bicycle with an acceleration of 3 ms Thus the force of friction between the road and the tyres is 80 AND Generally mass and weight are considered similar quantities but it is not correct They are two different quantities Mass of a body is the quantity of matter possessed by the body It is a scalar quantity and does not change with change of place It is measured by comparison with standard masses using a beam balance On the other hand weight of a body is the force equal to the force with which Earth attracts it It varies depending upon the value of g acceleration due toHereNet ForceForce of frictionAs net Force Net force  Applied Force  Force of frictionHenceFigure 37 Spring balance is used to measure the force or weight of a bodyUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 62RWgravity Weight woi a body of mass m is related by the equation w  mg  35Weight is a force and thus it is a vector quantity Its SI unit is newton N the same as force Weight is measured by a spring LAW OF third law of motion deals with the reaction of a body when a force acts on it Let a body Aexerts a force on another body B the body B reacts against this force and exerts a force on body A The force exerted by body A on B is the action force whereas the force exerted by body B on A is called the reaction force Newtons third law of motion states thatTo every action there is always an equal but opposite reaction According to this law action is always accompanied by a reaction force and the two forces must always be equal and opposite Note that action and reaction forces act on different bodies Consider a book lying on a table as shown in figure 38 The weight of the book is acting on the table in the downward direction This is the action The reaction of the table acts on the book in the upward direction Consider another example Take an airfilled balloon as shown in figure 39 When the balloon is set free the air inside it rushes out and the balloon moves forward In this example the action is by the balloon that pushes the air out of it when set free The reaction of the air which escapes out from the balloon acts on the balloon It is due to this reaction of the escaping air that moves the balloon forward A rocket such as shown in figure 310 moves on the same principle When its fuel burns hot gases escape out from its tail with a very high speed The Figure 310 A Rocket taking offFigure 39 Reaction of the airpushed out of the balloon moves itFigure 38 Action of the bookand reaction on itUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 63Unit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 64reaction of these gases on the rocket causes it to move opposite to the gases rushing out of its AND IN A a block supported by a string The upper end of the string is fixed on a stand as shown in figure 311 Let w be the weight of the block The block pulls the string downwards by its weight This causes a tension T in the string The tension T in the string is acting upwards at the block As the block is at rest therefore the weight of the block acting downwards must be balanced by the upwards tension T in the string Thus the tension T in the string must be equal and opposite to the weight w of the OF TWO TO THE OF A A two bodies A and B of masses m and m 1 2respectively Let m is greater than m The bodies are 1 2attached to the opposite ends of an inextensible string The string passes over a frictionless pulley as shown in figure 312 The body A being heavier must be moving downwards with some acceleration Let this acceleration be a At the same time the body B attached to the other end of the string moves up with the same acceleration a As the pulley is frictionless hence tension will be the same throughout the string Let the tension in the string be TSince the body A moves downwards hence its weight m g is greater than the tension T in the string1 Net force acting on body A  m g T1Quick QuizStretch out your palm and hold a book on it123T w A a T B m g2a Tm g1Figure 311 Weight of the block pulls the

hence its weight m g 2is less than the tension T in the string Net force acting on body B  T m g2According to Newtons second law of motionAdding Eq 36 and Eq37 we get acceleration aDivide Eq 37 by Eq 36 to find tension T in the stringThe above arrangement is also known as Atwood machine It can be used to find the acceleration gdue to gravity using Eq 34Two masses 52 kg and 48 kg are attached to the ends of an inextensible string which passes over a frictionless pulley Find the acceleration in the system and the tension in the string when both the masses are moving verticallyAn Atwood machine is an arrangement of two objects of unequal masses such as shown in figure 312 Both the objects are attached to the ends of a string The string passes over a frictionless pulley This arrangement is sometime used to find the acceleration due to gravitya2Thus the acceleration in the system is 04 ms and tension in the string is 50 OF TWO TO THE OF A A ONE AND THE ON A two bodies A and B of masses m and 1m respectively attached to the ends of an inextensible 2string as shown in figure 313 Let the body A moves downwards with an acceleration a Since the string is inextensible therefore body B also moves over the horizontal surface with the same acceleration a As the pulley is frictionless hence tension T will be the same throughout the stringSince body A moves downwards therefore its weight m g is greater than the tension T in the string1Net force acting on body A  m g T1According to Newtons second law of motionThe forces acting on body B are i Weight m g of the body B acting downward 2ii Reaction R of the horizontal surface actingon body B in the upwards direction iii Tension T in the string pulling the body Bhorizontally over the smooth surfaceAs body B has no vertical motion hence resultant of vertical forcesm g and R must be zero2Thus the net force acting on body B is TAccording to Newtons second law of motionUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 66BRm g2m g1aTaAFigure 313 Motion of

35Two masses 4 kg and 6 kg are attached to the ends of an inextensible string which passes over a frictionless pulley such that mass 6 kg is moving over a frictionless horizontal surface and the mass 4 kg is moving vertically downwards  Find the acceleration in the system and the tension in the the acceleration in the system is 4 ms and tension in the string is 24N AND THE a body of mass m moving with initial velocity v Let a force F acts on the body which iproduces an acceleration a in it This changes the velocity of the body  Let its final velocity after time becomes v If P and P be the initial momentum andf i ffinal momentum of the body related to initial and final velocities respectively then Thus the rate of change in momentum is given by since is the rate of change of velocityequal to the acceleration a produced by the force FAccording to Newtons second law of motion Equation 314 also defines force and states Newtons second law of motion as When a force acts on a body it produces an acceleration in the body and will be equal to the rate of change of momentum of the bodySI unit of momentum defined by equation 314 is 1newtonsecond Ns which is the same as kgms 36A body of mass 5 kg is moving with a velocity of 110ms  Find the force required to stop it in 2 in  final initialmomentum momentum momentumDuring an accident crumple zones collapse This increases the impact time by providing extra time for crumpling The impact of force is highly reduced and saves the passengers from severe injuriesIn an accident at high speed the impact force is very large due to the extremely short stopping time For safety purposes vehicles have rigid cages for passengers with crumple zones at their front and rear enclosed in the cavities of these materials makes them flexible and soft During any mishap they increase the impact time on fragile objects An increase in impact time lowers the rate of change of momentum and hence lessens the impact of force This lowers the possible damage due to an accidentFragile objects such as glass wares etc are packed with suitable materials such as styrofoam rings balls polythene sheets with air sacks etcUnit 3 Dynamics

suddenly by something before him This something may be a windscreen another passenger or back of the seat in front of himher Seatbelts are useful in two ways• They provide an external force to a person wearing seatbelt• The additional time is required for stretching seat belts This prolongs the stopping time for momentum to change and reduces the effect of collisionFigure 314 Collision of two bodies of spherical shapes Thus 25 N force is required to stop the bodyLAW OF OF of a system depends on its mass and velocity A system is a group of bodies within certain boundaries An isolated system is a group of interacting bodies on which no external force is acting If no unbalanced or net force acts on a system then according to equation 314 its momentum remains constant Thus the momentum of an isolated system is always conserved This is the Law of Conservation of Momentum It states that The momentum of an isolated system of two or more than two interacting bodies remains constantConsider the example of an airfilled balloon as described under the third law of motion In this case balloon and the air inside it form a system Before releasing the balloon the system was at rest and hence the initial momentum of the system was zero As soon as the balloon is set free air escapes out of it with some velocity The air coming out of it possesses momentum To conserve momentum the balloon moves in a direction opposite to that of air rushing outConsider an isolated system of two spheres of masses m and m as shown in figure 314 They are 1 2moving in a straight line with initial velocities u and u1 2Unit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 70respectively such that u is greater than u  Sphere of mass 1 2m approaches the sphere of mass m as they move1 2Initial momentum of mass m  m u Initial

According to the law of conservation of momentumEquation 317 shows that the momentum of an isolated system before and after collisions remains the same which is the law of conservation of momentum Law of conservation of momentum is an important law and has vast applicationsConsider a system of gun and a bullet Before firing the gun both the gun and bullet are at rest so the total momentum of the system is zero As the gun is fired bullet shoots out of the gun and acquires momentum To conserve momentum of the system the gun recoils According to the law of conservation of momentum the total momentum of the gun and the bullet will also be zero after the gun is fired Let m be the mass of the bullet and v be its velocity on firing the gun M be the mass of the gun and V be the velocityTotal initial momentum of the system before collisionTotal final momentum the system after collisionTotal final momentum of the system after collision  m vmv 3161 1 2 2Unit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 71Equation 319 gives the velocity  of the gun Negative sign indicates that velocity of the gun is opposite to the velocity of the bullet ie the gun recoils Since mass of the gun is much larger than the bullet therefore the recoil is much smaller than the velocity of the bulletRockets and jet engines also work on the same principle In these machines hot gases produced by burning of fuel rush out with large momentum The machines gain an equal and opposite momentum This enables them to move with very high 37A bullet of mass 20 g is fired from a gun with a 1muzzle velocity 100 ms  Find the recoil of the gun if its mass is 5 which it recoils Thus the total momentum of the gun and the bullet after the gun is fired will beAccording to the law of conservation of momentumTotal momentum of the gun and the bullet after the gun is firedTotal momentum of the gun and the bullet after the gun is firedTotal momentum of the gun and the bullet before the gun is firedorHenceAccording to the law of conservation of momentumPutting the values we get The negative sign indicates that the gun recoils ie moves in the backward direction opposite to the motion of 1the bullet with a velocity of 04 ms 3Naturally there must be some force that stops moving objects  Since a force not only moves an object but also stops moving object  The force that opposes the motion of moving objects is called friction Friction is a force that comes into action as soon as a body is pushed or pulled over a surface In case of solids  the force of friction between two bodies depends upon many factors such as nature of the two surfaces in contact and the pressing force between them Rub your palm over different surfaces such as table  carpet polished marble surface brick etc You will find smoother is the surface easier it is to move over the surface Moreover  harder you press your palm over the surface more difficult would it be to move No surface is perfectly smooth A surface that appears smooth has pits and bumps that can be seen under a microscope  Figure 317 shows two wooden blocks with their polished surfaces in contact A magnified view of two smooth surfaces in contact shows the gaps andFigure 315 A cyclist keeps on pedalling to overcome frictionFigure 316 To walk or to run friction is needed to push the ground backwardUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 72Coldweldscontacts between them The contact points between the two surfaces form a sort of coldwelds These cold welds resist the surfaces from sliding over each other Adding weight over the upper block increases the force pressing the surfaces together and hence increases the resistance Thus greater is the pressing force greater will be the friction between the sliding surfacesFriction is equal to the applied force that tends to move a body at rest It increases with the applied force Friction can be increased to certain maximum value It does not increase beyond this The maximum value of friction is known as the force of limiting friction F  It sdepends on the normal reaction pressing force between the two surfaces in contact The ratio between the force of limiting friction F and the normal reaction R is constant sThis constant is called the coefficient of friction and is represented byFriction is needed to walk on the ground It is risky to run on wet floor with shoes that have smooth soles Athletes use special shoes that have extraordinary ground grip Such shoes prevent them from slipping while running fast We will apply brakes The rubber padsFigure 317 A magnified view of the two surfaces in the opposite walls by palms and feet increases friction This enables the boy to move up on the wallsCoefficient of friction betweensome common materialsThusorIf m be the mass of the block then for horizontal surfaceHenceUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 73Unit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 74pressed against the rims provide friction It is the friction that stops the bicycle Wheel is one of the most important inventions in the history of mankind The first thing about a wheel is that it rolls as it moves rather than to slide This greatly reduces friction When the axle of a wheel is pushed the force of friction between the wheel and the ground at the point of contact provides the reaction force The reaction force acts at the contact points of the wheel in a direction opposite to the applied force The wheel rolls without rupturing the cold welds That is why the rolling friction is extremely small than sliding friction The fact that rolling friction is less than sliding friction is applied in ball bearings or roller bearings to reduce losses due to frictionThe wheel would not roll on pushing it if there would be no friction between the wheel and the ground Thus friction is desirable for wheels to roll over a surface It is dangerous to drive on a wet road because the friction between the road and the tyres is very small This increases the chance of slipping the tyres from the road The threading on tyres is designed to increase friction Thus threading improves road grip and make it safer to drive even on wet roadA cyclist applies brakes to stop hisher bicycle As soon as brakes are applied the wheels stop rolling and begin to slide over the road Since sliding friction is Force 318 Friction may cause the body to rollFigure 319 A ball bearingFigure 320 Threading on tyres provides good road gripUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 75much greater than rolling friction Therefore the cycle stops very AND wheels of a moving vehicle have two velocity componentsi motion of wheels along the roadii rotation of wheels about their axisTo move a vehicle on the road as well as to stop a moving vehicle requires friction between its tyres and the road For example if the road is slippery or the tyres are worn out then the tyres instead of rolling slip over the road The vehicle will not move if the wheels start slipping at the same point on the slippery road Thus for the wheels to roll the force of friction gripping force between the tyres and the road must be enough that prevents them from slipping Similarly to stop a car quickly a large force of friction between the tyres and the road is needed But there is a limit to this force of friction that tyres can provide If the brakes are applied too strongly the wheels of the car will lock up stop turning and the car will skid due to its large momentum It will lose its directional control that may result in an accident In order to reduce the chance of skidding it is advisable not to apply brakes too hard that lock up their rolling motion especially at high speeds Moreover it is unsafe to drive a vehicle with worn out AND OF Friction has the advantages as well as disadvantages Friction is undesirable when moving at high speeds because it opposes the motion and thusFigure 321 A car Exercise1 i rolling ii sliding2i rough groundii smooth groundUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 76limits the speed of moving objects Most of our useful energy is lost as heat and sound due to the friction between various moving parts of machines In machines friction also causes wear and tear of their moving partsHowever sometimes friction is most desirable We cannot write if there would be no friction between paper and the pencil Friction enables us to walk on the ground We cannot run on a slippery ground A slippery ground offers very little friction Hence anybody who tries to run on a slippery ground may meet an accident Similarly it is dangerous to apply brakes with full force to stop a fast moving vehicle on a slippery road Birds could not fly if there is no air resistance The reaction of pushed air enables the birds to fly Thus in many situations we need friction while in other situations we need to reduce it as much as possibleWrite a dream during which you are driving a car and suddenly the friction disappears What happened OF friction can be reduced by i  making the sliding surfaces smoothii making the fast moving objects a streamline shape fish shape such as cars aero planes etc This causes the smooth flow of air and thus minimizes air resistance at high speeds iii Lubricating the sliding surfacesiv Using ball bearings or roller bearings Because the rolling friction is lesser than the sliding friction34 come across many things in our daily life that are moving along circular path Take a small stone Tie it at one end of a string and keep the other end of the string in your hand as shown in figure 324Friction is highly desirable when climbing up a hillFigure 322 Smooth air flow at high speeds reduces air resistanceFigure 323 Streamlining the bullet train reduces air resistance at high speedThe moon The Earth 3 Dynamics Physics IX 77Figure 324 Circular motion of a stone attached with a stringFigure 326 Centripetal force is always directed towards the centre and has no component in the direction of motionFigure 327 a A string provides necessary centripetal forceb A string is unable to provide the required centripetal force Now rotate the stone holding the string The stone will move in a circular path The motion of stone will be called as circular motion Similarly motion of the moon around the Earth is circular motion The motion of an object in a circular path is known as circular a body tied at the end of a string moving with uniform speed in a circular path A body has the tendency to move in a straight line due to inertia The string to which the body is tied keeps it to move in a circle by pulling the body towards the centre of the circle The string pulls the body perpendicular to its motion as shown in figure 326 This pulling force continuously changes the direction of motion and remains towards the centre of the circle This centre seeking force is called the centripetal force It keeps the body to move in a circle Centripetal force always acts perpendicular to the motion of the body Centripetal force is a force that keeps a body to move in a circleLet us study the centripetal forces in the following examplesi Figure 327 shows a stone tied to one end of a string rotating in a circle The tension in the string provides the necessary centripetal force It keeps the stone to remain in the circle If the string is not strong enough to provide the necessary tension it breaks and the stoneFigure 324 Circular motion of a stone attached with a string Centripetalforce CentrifugalforceUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 78 moves away along a tangent to the circle as shown in figure 327bii The moon revolves around the Earth The gravitational force of the Earth provides the necessary centripetal force Let a body of mass m moves with uniform speed v in a circle of radius r The acceleration a produced by the c centripetal force F is given by c centripetal acceleration According to Newtons second law of motion the centripetal force F is given by c Equation 326 shows that the centripetal force needed by a body moving in a circle depends on the mass m of the body square of its velocity v and reciprocal to the radius r of the a stone shown in figure 328 tied to a string moving in a circle The necessary centripetal force acts on the stone through the string that keeps it to move in a circle According to Newtons third law of motion there exists a reaction to this centripetal force Centripetal reaction that pulls the string outward is sometimes called the centrifugal 38A stone of mass 100 g is attached to a string 1m long The stone is rotating in a circle with a speed of 15 ms  Find the tension in the 3While the coaster cars move around the loop the track provides centripetal force preventing them to move away from the circleUnit 3 Dynamics Physics IX 79 Thus tension in the string will be equal to 25 OF THE a car takes a turn centripetal force is needed to keep it in its curved track The friction between the tyres and the road provides the necessary centripetal force The car would skid if the force of friction between the tyres and the road is not sufficient enough particularly when the roads are wet This problem is solved by banking of curved roads Banking of a road means that the outer edge of a road is raised Imagine a vehicle on a curved road such as shown

collected through a pipeFigure 331 A Cream force is a push or pull It moves or tends to move stops or tends to stop the motion of a bodyInertia of a body is its property due to which it resists any change in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight lineMomentum of a body is the quantity of motion possessed by the body Momentum of a body is equal to the product of its mass and velocityThe force that opposes the motion of a body is called frictionNewtons first law of motion states that a body continues its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line provided no net force acts on itNewtons second law of motion states that when a net force acts on a body it produces acceleration in the body in the direction of the net force The magnitude of this acceleration is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass Mathematically F  maSI unit of force is newton N It is defined as the force which produces 2 an acceleration

acting In many cases we find all or some of the forces acting on a body in the same direction For example many people push a bus to start it All these forces are applied in the same direction so these are all parallel to each other Such forces which are parallel to each other are called parallel forces Figure 43 shows a bag with apples in it The weight of each apple weight of the bag is due to the weight of all the apples in it Since the weight of every apple in the bag is the force of gravity acting on it vertically downwards therefore weights of apples are the parallel forces All these forces are acting in the same direction Such forces are called like parallel forcesLike parallel forces are the forces that are parallel to each other and have the same direction In figure 44a an apple is suspended by a string The string is stretched due to weight of the apple The forces acting on it are weight of the apple acting vertically downwards and tension in the string pulling it vertically upwards The two forces are parallel but opposite to each other These forces are called unlike parallel forces In figure 44b forces F and Fare also unlike parallel 1 2 forces because they are parallel and opposite to each other But F and F are not acting along the same line and 1 2hence they are capable to rotate the bodyUnlike parallel forces are the forces that are parallel but have directions opposite to each other42 OF Force is a vector quantity It has both magnitude and direction therefore forces are not added by ordinary arithmetical rules When forces are added we get a resultant forceA resultant force is a single force that has the same effect as the combined effect of all the forces to be addedWeight of each appleFigure 43 Like parallel forcesPhysics IX A B W S N E R A B 37o C D F

called resolution of forces If a force is formed from two mutually perpendicular components then such components are called its perpendicular componentsSplitting up of a force into two mutually perpendicular components is called the resolution of that forceConsider a force F represented by line OA making an angle with xaxis as shown in figure 47Draw a perpendicular AB on xaxis from A According to head to tail rule OA is the resultant of vectors represented by OB and components OB and BA are perpendicular to each other They are called the perpendicular components of OA representing

opened or closed due to the turning effect of the force acting on body is composed of large number of small particles If the distances between all pairs of particles of the body do not change by applying a force then it is called a rigid body In other words a rigid body is the one that is not deformed by force or forces acting on OF Consider a rigid body rotating about a line The particles of the body move in circles with their centres all lying on this line This line is called the axis of rotation of the body Forces that produce turning effect are very common Turning pencil in a sharpener turning stopcock of a water tap turning doorknob and so on are some of the examples where a force produces turning some more objects that work by the turning effects of forcesThe turning effect of a force is called torque or moment of the force We can open or close a door more easily by applying a force at the outer edge of a door rather than near the hinge Thus the location where the force is applied to turn a body is very importantFigure 49 It is easy to open and close the door by pulling or pushing it at its handleFigure 410 Turning effect of forcesMoment armMoment armForceForce Moment

uses a spanner as shown in figure 411 to loosen or tighten a nut or a bolt A spanner having long arm helps him to do it with greater ease than the oneFigure 411 It is easy to tighten a nut using a spanner of longer arm than a spanner of shorter armhaving short arm It is because the turning effect of the force is different in the two cases The moment produced by a force using a spanner of longer arm is greater than the torque produced by the same force but using a spanner of shorter OF OF A line along which a force acts is called the line of action of the force In figure 412 line BC is the line of action of force perpendicular distance between the axis of rotation and the line of action of the force is called the moment arm of the force It is represented by the distance L in figure 412The torque or moment of a force depends upon the force F and the moment arm L of the force Greater is a force greater is the moment of the force Similarly  longer is the moment arm greater is the moment of the force Thus the moment of the force or torque is determined by the product of force F and its moment arm L Mathematically Figure 412 Factors affecting the moment of a 4 Turning Effect of

long spanner by exerting a force of 200 N Find the torque that has tightened a torque of 30 N m is used to tighten the nut45 OF force that turns a spanner in the clockwise direction is generally used to tighten a nut as shown in figure 413a The torque or moment of the force so produced is called clockwise moment On the other hand to loosen a nut the force is applied such that it turns the nut in the anticlockwise direction as shown in figure 413b The torque or moment of the force so produced is called anticlockwise momentA body initially at rest does not rotate if sum of all the clockwise moments acting on it is balanced by the sum of all the anticlockwise moments acting on it This is known as the principle of moments According to the principle of momentsA body is balanced if the sum of clockwise moments acting on the body is equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments acting on it Two children are sitting on the seesaw such that they can not swingUsingFigure 413 a to tighten nut is

system moves as if its entire mass is confined at that point A force applied at such a point in the body does not produce any torque in it ie the body moves in the direction of net force F without

particleas shown in figure 419 In this case also thesystem moves as well as rotatesCentre of mass of a system is such a point where an applied force causes the system to move without rotation46 OF body is made up of a large number of particles as illustrated in figure 420 Earth attracts each of these particles vertically downward towards its centre The pull of the Earth acting on a particle is equal to its weight These forces acting on the particles of a body are almost parallel The resultant of all these parallel forces is a single force equal to the weight of the body A point where this resultant force acts vertically towards the centre of the Earth is called the centre of gravity G of the bodyA point where the whole weight of the body appears to act vertically downward is called centre of gravity of a bodyIt is useful to know the location of the centre of gravity of a body in problems dealing with equilibriumFigure 417 A force applied at COM moves the system without

balanced This balance point is its middle point G as shown in figure 421Figure 421 Centre of gravity is at the middle of a uniform rodThe centre of a gravity of a uniform square or a rectangular sheet is the point of intersection of its diagonals as shown in figure 422 a and c The centre of gravity of a uniform circular disc is its centre as shown in figure 422b Similarly the centre of gravity of a solid sphere or hollow sphere is the centre of the spheres as shown in figure 422bThe centre of gravity of a uniform triangular sheet is the point of intersection of its medians as shown in figure 422 d The centre of gravity of a uniform circular ring is the centre of the ring as shown in figure 422e The centre of gravity of a uniform solid or hollow cylinder is the middle point on its axis as shown in figure 422fFigure 422 Centre of gravity of some symmetrical objectsGwCentre of OF OF AN simple method to find the centre of gravity of a body is by the use of a plumbline A plumbline consists of a small metal bob lead or brass supported by a string When the bob is suspended freely by the string it rests along the vertical direction due to its weight acting vertically downward as shown in

forces that produce a torque  This torque turns the steering wheel  These forces act on opposite sides of the steering wheel as shown in figure 424 and are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction  These two forces form a couple A couple is formed by two unlike parallel forces of the same magnitude but not along the same lineA double arm spanner is used to open a nut Equal forces each of

distance between them48 first law of motion tells us that a body continues its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line if no resultant or net force acts on it For example a book lying on a table or a picture hanging on a wall are at rest The weight of the book acting downward is balanced by the upward reaction of the table Consider a log of wood of weight w supported by ropes as shown in figure 426 Here the weight w is balanced by the forces F 1and F pulling the log upward In case of objects moving with 2uniform velocity the resultant force acting on them is zero A car moving with uniform velocity on a levelled road and an aeroplane flying in the air with uniform velocity are the examples of bodies in equilibriumA body is said to be in equilibrium if no net force acts on itA body in equilibrium thus remains at rest or moves with uniform FOR the above examples we see that a body at rest or in uniform motion is in equilibrium if the resultant force acting on it is zero For a body in equilibrium it must satisfy certain conditions There are two conditions for a body to be in FOR body is said to satisfy first condition for equilibrium if the resultant of all the forces

Physics IXThe first condition for equilibrium can also be stated in terms of x and ycomponents of the forces acting on the body asA book lying on a table or a picture hanging on a wall are at rest and thus satisfy first condition for equilibrium  A paratrooper coming down with terminal velocity constant velocity  also satisfies first condition for equilibrium and is thus in equilibrium 45A block of weight 10 N is hanging through a cord as shown in figure 429 Find the tension in the cord Applying first condition for equilibriumThere is no force acting along xaxisThus the tension in the cord is 10 FOR condition for equilibrium does not ensure that a body is in equilibrium  This is clear from the following example  Consider a body pulled by the forces F and Fas shown in figure 430a The two 1 2 forces are equal but opposite to each other Both are acting along the same line hence their resultant will be zero According to the first condition  the body will be inandFigure 428 A paratrooper

the first condition for equilibrium is still satisfied It is because the body has the tendency to rotate This situation demands another condition for equilibrium in addition to the first condition for equilibrium This is called second condition for equilibrium According to this a body satisfies second condition for equilibrium when the resultant torque acting on it is zero 1 A ladder leaning at a wall as shown in figure 431 is in equilibrium 2 The weight of the ladder in figure 431 produces an anticlockwise torque The wall pushes the ladder at its top end thus produces a clockwise torque 3 46

of these three states of equilibrium 433 Stable equilibrium a A book is lying on a table b The book returns to its previous position when let free after a slight tiltConsider a book lying on the table  Tilt the book slightly about its one edge by lifting it from the opposite side as shown in figure 433 It returns to its previousorG G G a b cUnit 4 Turning Effect of Forces 101 Physics IXposition when sets free Such a state of the body is called stable equilibrium ThusA body is said to be in stable equilibrium if after a slight tilt it returns to its previous positionWhen a body is in stable equilibrium its centre of gravity is at the lowest position When it is tilted its centre of gravity rises It returns to its stable state by lowering its centre of gravity A body remains in stable equilibrium as long as the centre of gravity acts through the base of the bodyConsider a block as shown in figure 434 When the block is tilted its centre of gravity G rises If the vertical line through G passes through its base in the tilted position as shown in figure 434 b the block returns to its previous position If the vertical line through G gets out of its base as shown in figure 434c the block does not return to its previous position It topples over its base and moves to newFigure 434 a Block in stable equilibrium b Slightly tilted block is returning to its previous position c A more tilted block topples over its base and does not return to its previous positionstable equilibrium position That is why a vehicle is made heavy at its bottom to keep its centre of gravity as low as possible A lower centre of gravity keeps it stable Moreover the base of a vehicle is made wide so that the vertical line passing through its centre of gravity should not get out of its base during a a pencil and try to keep it in the vertical position on its tip as shown in figure 436 Whenever you leave it the pencil topples over about its tip and falls down This is called the unstable equilibrium In unstable equilibrium a body may be made to stay only b a Topple over GG Figure 436 Unstable equilibriuma pencil just balanced at its tip with centre of gravity G at the highest position b Pencil topples over caused by the torque of its weight acting at GFigure 435 A double decker bus being under test for stabilityb a are made heavy at the bottom This lowers their centre of gravity and helps to increase their stability Unit 4 Turning Effect of Forces 102 Physics IXfor a moment Thus a body is unable to keep itself in the state of unstable equilibrium ThusIf a body does not return to its previous position when sets free after a slightest tilt is said to be in unstable equilibriumThe centre of gravity of the body is at its highest position in the state of unstable equilibrium As the body topples over about its base tip its centre of gravity moves towards its lower position and does not return to its previous a ball and place it on a horizontal surface as shown in figure 437 Roll the ball over the surface and leave it after displacing from its previous position It remains in its new position and does not return to its previous position This is called neutral equilibriumIf a body remains in its new position when disturbed from its previous position it is said to be in a state of neutral equilibriumIn neutral equilibrium all the new states in which a body is moved are the stable states and the body remains in its new state In neutral equilibrium the centre of gravity of the body remains at the same height irrespective to its new position There are various objects which have neutral equilibrium such as a ball a sphere a roller a pencil lying horizontally an egg lying horizontally on a flat surface etc49 AND OF OF As we have learnt that position of centre of mass of an object plays an important role in their stability To make them stable their centre of mass must be kept as low as possible It is due to this reason racing cars are made heavy at the bottom and their height is kept to be minimum Circus artists such as tight rope walkers use long poles to lower their centre of mass In this way they are prevented from topple over Here are few examples in which lowering of centre of mass make the objects stable These Figure 438 A needle is made to balance at its tipFigure 437 Neutral equilibriuma a ball is placed on a horizontal surface b the ball

1dm mG F Unit 5 Gravitation 107 Physics IXThe first man who came up with the idea of gravity was Isaac Newton It was an evening of 1665 when he was trying to solve the mystery why planets revolve around the Sun Suddenly an apple fell from the tree under which he was sitting The idea of gravity flashed in his mind He discovered not only the cause of falling apple but also the cause that makes the planets to revolve around the Sun and the moon around the Earth This unit deals with the concepts related to gravitation51 THE OF the basis of his observations Newton concluded that the force which causes an apple to fall on the Earth and the force which keeps the moon in its orbit are of the same nature He further concluded that there exists a force due to which everybody of the universe attracts every other body He named this force the force of gravitationLAW OF to Newtons law of universal gravitationEverybody in the universe attracts every other body with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centresConsider two bodies of masses m and m  The 1 2distance between the centres of masses is d as shown in figure 51Figure 51 Two masses attract each other with a gravitational force of equal magnitudeUnit 5 Gravitation 108 Physics IXAccording to the law of gravitation the gravitational force of attraction F with which the two masses m and m separated by a distance d attract each 1 2other is given byHere G is the proportionality constant It is called the universal constant of gravitation Its value is same 11 2 2everywhere In SI units its value is 6673x1 10 Nm kg  Due to small value of G the gravitational force of attraction between objects around us is very small and we do not feel it Since the mass of Earth is very large it attracts nearby objects with a significant force The weight of an object on the Earth is the result of gravitational force of attraction between the Earth and the objectLAW OF AND LAW OF is to be noted that mass m attracts mtowards it 1 2 with a force F while mass m attracts mtowards it with a 2 1 force of the same magnitude F but in opposite direction If the force acting on m is considered as action then the 1force acting on m will be the reaction The action and 2reaction due to force of gravitation are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction This is consistent with Newtons third law of motion which states to every action there is always an equal but opposite 51Two lead spheres each of mass 1000 kg are kept with their centres 1 m apart Find the gravitational force with which they attract each 52 Weight of a body is due to the gravitational force between the body and the the values  we getThus gravitational force of attraction between the lead spheres to the Newton s law of gravitation  the gravitational force between a body of mass m and the Earth is given bywhere M is the mass of the Earth and r is the edistance of the body from the centre of the EarthThe weight of a body is due to the gravitational force with which the Earth attracts a body  Gravitational force is a noncontact force For example  the velocity of a body  thrown up goes on decreasing while on return its velocity goes on increasing  This is due to the gravitational pull of the Earth acting on the body whether the body is in contact with the Earth or not Such a force is called the field force It is assumed that a gravitational field exists all around the Earth This field is directed towards the centre of the Earth as shown by arrows in figure 53 The gravitational field becomes weaker and weaker as we go farther and farther away from the Earth In the gravitational field of the Earth the gravitational force per unit mass is calledHereFigure 53 Gravitational field around the Earth is towards its centreUnit 5 Gravitation 109 Physics IXthe gravitational field strength of the Earth At any place its value is equal to the value of g at that point Near the surface of the Earth the gravitational field strength is 110 N kg 52 OF THE a body of mass m on the surface of the Earth as shown in figure 54 Let the mass of the Earth be M and radius of the Earth be R The distance of the body efrom the centre of the Earth will also be equal to the radius R of the Earth According to the law of gravitation the gravitational force F of the Earth acting on a body is given byBut the force with which Earth attracts a body towards its centre is equal to its weight w ThereforeMass M of the Earth can be determined on eputting the values in equation 57Thus mass of the Earth is 6 x 10 kg53 OF G 56 shows that the value of acceleration due to gravity g depends on the radius 54 Weight of a body is equal to the gravitational force between the body and the EarthUnit 5 Gravitation 110 Physics Earth at its surface The value of g is inversely proportional to the square of the radius of the Earth But it does not remain constant It decreases with altitude Altitude is the height of an object or place above sea level The value of g is greater at sea level than at the hillsConsider a body of mass m at an altitude h as shown in figure 55 The distance of the body from the centre of the Earth becomes R  h Therefore using equation 56 we getAccording to the above equation we come to know that at a height equal to one Earth radius above the surface of the Earth g becomes one fourth of its value on the Earth Similarly at a distance of two Earths radius above the Earths surface the value of g becomes one ninth of its value on the 52Calculate the value of g the acceleration due to gravity at an altitude 1000 km The mass of the Earth is 24 60 x 10 kg The radius of the Earth is 6400 55 Weight of a body decreases as its height increases from the surface of the EarthMini Exercise123Value of g on the surface of a celestial object depends on its mass and its radius The value of g on some of the objects is given belowUnit 5 Gravitation 111 Physics IXThus the value of g the acceleration due to 2gravity at an altitude of 1000 km will be 73 ms54 object that revolves around a planet is called a satellite The moon revolves around the Earth so moon is a natural satellite of the Earth Scientists have sent many objects into space Some of these objects revolve around the Earth These are called artificial satellites Most of the artificial satellites orbiting around the Earth are used for communication purposes Artificial satellites carry instruments or passengers to perform experiments in spaceFigure 56 A satellite is orbiting around the Earth at a height h above the surface of the EarthLarge number of artificial satellites have been launched in different orbits around the Earth They take different time to complete their one revolution around the Earth depending upon their distance h from the Earth Communication satellites take 24 hours to complete their one revolution around the Earth As Earth also completes its one rotation about its axis in 24 hours hence these communication satellites appear to be stationary with respect to Earth It is due to this reason that the orbit of such a satellite is called geostationary orbit Dish antennas sending and receiving the signals from them have fixed direction depending upon their location on the EarthThe height of a geostationary satellite is about 42300 km from the surface of the Earth Its velocity with respect to Earth is zeroGlobal Positioning System GPS is a satellites navigation system It helps us to find the exact position of an object anywhere on the land on the sea or in the air GPS consists of 24 Earth satellites  These satellites revolve around the Earth twice a day with a speed of 1387 km s Unit 5 Gravitation 113 Physics OF satellite requires centripetal force that keeps it to move around the Earth The gravitational force of attraction between the satellite and the Earth provides the necessary centripetal forceConsider a satellite of mass m revolving round the Earth at an altitude h in an orbit of radius r with orbital ovelocity v The necessary centripetal force required is ogiven by equation 326This force is provided by the gravitational force of attraction between the Earth and the satellite and is equal to the weight of the satellite w mg ThusEquation 510 gives the velocity  which a satellite must possess when launched in an orbit of radius r  R  h around the Earth An approximation ocan be made for a satellite revolving close to the Earth such that R  hA satellite revolving around very close to the 1 1Earth has speed vnearly 8 kms or 29000 kmh Moon is nearly 380000 km away from the Earth It completes its one revolution around the Earth in 273 daysandUnit 5 Gravitation 114 Physics

falling body list the efficient use of energy in the context of the home heating and cooling of buildings and transportation Generally work refers to perform some task or job In science work has precise meaning For example a man carrying a load is doing work but he is not doing work if he is not moving while keeping the load on his head Scientifically work is done only when an effort or force moves an object When work is done energy is used Thus work and energy are related to each other The concept of energy is an important concept in Physics It helps us to identify the changes that occur when work is done This unit deals with the concepts of work power and energy61 Physics work is said to be done when a force acts on a body and moves it in the direction of the force Naturally greater is the force acting on a body and longer is the distance moved by it larger would be the work done Mathematically Work is a product of force F and displacement S in the direction of force ThusWork done  Force x displacementFigure 61 Work done in displacing a body in the direction of forceor119Unit 6 Work and Energy Physics IXSometimes force and displacement do not have the same direction such as shown in figure 62 Here the force F is making an angle with the surface on whichFigure 62 Work done by a force inclined with the displacementthe body is moved Resolving F into its perpendicular components F and F asx yIn case when force and displacement are not parallel then only the xcomponent F parallel to the xsurface causes the body to move on the surface and not the y  component FyHenceWork is done when a force acting on a body displaces it in the direction of a forceWork is a scalar quantity It depends on the force acting on a body displacement of the body and the angle between OF unit of work is joule J It is defined asThe amount of work is one joule when a force of one newton displaces a body through one metre in the direction of forceThusJoule is a small unit of

upstairs to a height of 18 steps each 20 cm high Calculate the amount of work 2she has done to carry the bag Take g 10 of the bag Weight of the bag To carry the bag upstairs  the girl exerts an upward force F equal to w the weight of the bag ThusHeightThe girl has done 360 J of work62 energy is an important and fundamental concept in science  It links almost all the natural phenomena  When we say that a body has energy  we mean that it has the ability to do work Water running down the stream has the ability to do work so it possesses energy  The energy of running water can be used to run water mills or water turbines Energy exists in various forms such as mechanical energy  heat energy  light energy  sound energy  electrical energy  chemical energy and nuclear energy etc Energy can be transformed from one form into another  A body possesses energy if it is capable to do workMechanical energy possessed by a body is of two types kinetic energy and potential energy 63 air is called wind We can use wind energy for doing various things  It drives windmills and pushes sailing boats Similarly  moving water in a river can carry wooden logs through large distances andFigure 63 Running water possesses energyFigure 64 Energy of the wind moves the sailing boats121w  mgUnit 6 Work and Energy Physics IXcan also be used to drive turbines for generating electricity Thus a moving body has kinetic energy because it can do work due to its motion The body stops moving as soon as all of its kinetic energy is used upThe energy possessed by a body due to its motion is called its kinetic energyConsider a body of mass m moving with velocity v The body stops after moving through some distance S due to some opposing force such as force of friction acting on it The body possesses kinetic energy and is capable to do work against opposing force F until all of its kinetic energy is used up KE of the body  Work done by it due to motionSince motion is opposed hence a is negative Using 3rd equation of motionEquation 65 gives the KE possessed by a body of mass m moving with velocity 62A stone of mass 500 g strikes the ground with a 1velocity of 20vms Eq63 and 64 we get122Unit 6 Work and Energy Physics IXabFigure 65 a Hammer raised up b stretched bow both possess potential energy Thus the kinetic energy of the stone is 100 J as it strikes the ground64 a body has the ability to do work although it is at rest For example an apple on a tree is capable to do work as it falls Thus it possesses energy due to its position The kind of energy which a body possesses due to its position is called its potential energyThe energy possessed by a body due to its position is known as its potential energyStored water possesses potential energy due to its height A hammer raised up to some height has the ability to do work because it possesses potential energy A stretched bow has potential energy due to its stretched position When released the stored energy of the bow pushes the arrow out of it The energy present in the stretched bow is called elastic potential energyThe potential energy possessed by a hammer is due to its height The energy present in a body due to its height is called gravitational potential energyLet a body of mass m be raised up through height h from the ground The body will acquire potential energy equal to the work done in lifting it to height hThus Potential energy Here weight of the bodySince123Unit 6 Work and Energy Physics IXasmass mheight the potential energy possessed by the body with respect to the ground is mgh and is equal to the work done in lifting it to height 63A body of mass 50 kg is raised to a height of 3 m g  10 ms potential energy of the body is 1500 64A force of 200 N acts on a body of mass 20 kg The force accelerates the body from rest until it attains 1a velocity of 50 ms Work done on the body  KE gained by itThus the distance moved by the body is 125 m124 Mechanical Energy SoundEnergyChemical Energy Electrical

energy possessed by a body both due to its motion or position is called mechanical energy Water running down a stream wind a moving car a lifted hammer a stretched bow a catapult or a compressed spring etc possess mechanical is a form of energy given out by hot bodies Large amount of heat is obtained by burning fuel Heat is also produced when motion is opposed by frictional forces The foods we take provide us heat energy The Sun is the main source of heat is one of the widely used form of energy Electrical energy can be supplied easily to any desired place through wires We get electrical energy from batteries and electric generators These electric generators are run by hydro power thermal or nuclear powerFigure 67 A watermillFigure 68 Heat energy coming from the SunFigure 69 Most of the things of our daily use need electrical energy for their operation125Unit 6 Work and Energy Physics you knock at the door you produce sound Sound is a form of energy It is produced when a body vibrates such as vibrating diaphragm of a drum vibrating strings of a sitar and vibrating air column of wind instruments such as flute pipe is an important form of energy Name some sources of light that you come acrossFigure 611 Light is needed during night alsoPlants produce food in the presence of light We also need light to see things We get light from candles electric bulbs fluorescent tubes and also by burning fuel However most of the light comes from the energy is present in food fuels and in other substances We get other forms of energy from these substances during chemical reactions The burning of wood coal or natural gas in air is a chemical reaction which releases energy as heat and light Electric energy is obtained from electric cells and batteries as a result of chemical reaction between various substances present in them Animals get heat and muscular energy from the food they eat126Figure 6Our body gets energy stored in the food we take to perform various

radiations in addition to heat and light during nuclear reactions such as fission and fusion reactions Heat energy released in nuclear reactors is converted into electrical energy The energy coming from the Sun for the last billions of years is the result of nuclear reactions taking place on the Sun66 OF cannot be destroyed however it can be converted into some other forms For example rub your hands together quickly You will feel them warm You have used your muscular energy in rubbing hands as a result heat is produced In the process of rubbing hands mechanical energy is converted into heat energyProcesses in nature are the results of energy changes For example some of the heat energy from the Sun is taken up by water in the oceans ThisFigure 614 Interconversion of Energyincreases the thermal energy Thermal energy causes water to evaporate from the surface to form water vapours These vapours rise up and form clouds As they cool down they form water drops and fall down as rain Potential energy changes to kinetic energy as the rain falls This rain water may reach a lake or a dam As the rain water flows down its kinetic energy changes into thermal energy while parts of the kinetic energy of flowing water is used to wash away soil particles of rocks known as soil erosionA nuclear power plant uses the energy released in nuclear reactor such as fission to generate electric powerFigure 613 Interconversion of kinetic energy into potential energy and potential energy into kinetic energy127Unit 6 Work and Energy Physics IXDuring the interconversion of energy from one form to other forms the total energy at any time remains constant67 OF energy we use comes from the Sun wind and water power etc Actually all of the energy we get comes directly or indirectly from the use fossil fuels such as coal oil and gas to heat our houses and run industry and transport They are usually hydrocarbons compounds of carbon and hydrogen When they are burnt they combine with oxygen from the air The carbon becomes carbonFigure 615 A gas fielddioxide hydrogen becomes hydrogen oxide called water while energy is released as heat In case of coalCarbon  Oxygen carbon dioxide  heat energy Hydrocarbon  Oxygen carbon dioxide  water  heat energyThe fossil fuels took millions of years for their formation They are known as nonrenewable resources We are using fossil fuels at a very fast rate Their use is increasing day by day to meet our energy needs If we continue to use them at present rate they will soon be exhausted Once their supply is exhausted the world would face serious energy crisisA pole vaulter uses a flexible vaulting pole made of special material It is capable to store all the vaulters kinetic energy while bending in the form of potential energy The vaulter runs as fast as possible to gain speed The kinetic energy gained by the pole vaulter due to speed helps himher to rise up as the vaulter straightens Thus he attains height as the pole returns the potential energy stored by the vaulter in the poleFigure 616 Coal128Unit 6 Work and Energy Physics IXThus fossil fuels would not be able to meet our future energy needs This would cause serious social and economical problems for countries like us Therefore we must use them wisely and at the same time develop new energy sources for our future survivalMoreover fossil fuels release harmful waste products These wastes include carbon monooxide and other harmful gases which pollute theFigure 618 Pollution due to burning of fossil fuelenvironment This causes serious health problems such as headache tension nausea allergic reactions irritation of eyes nose and throat Long exposure of these harmful gases may cause asthma lungs cancer heart diseases and even damage to brain nerves and other organs of our nuclear power plants we get energy as a result of fission reaction During fission reaction heavy atoms such as Uranium atoms split up into smaller parts releasing a large amount of energy Nuclear power plants give out a lot of nuclear radiations and vast amount of heat A part of this heat is used to run power plants while lot of heat goes waste into the and water power are the renewable sources of energy They will not run out like coal oil and gasFigure 617 An oil fieldFigure 619 Nuclear fuel pallets used in nuclear reactors129Unit 6 Work and Energy Physics from water power is very cheap Dams are being constructed at suitable locations in different parts of the world Dams serve many purposes They help to control floods by storing water The water stored in dams is used for irrigation and also to generate electrical energy without creating much environmental problemsFigure 620 Energy stored in the water of a dam is used to run power THE energy is the energy coming from the Sun and is used directly and indirectly Sunlight does not pollute the environment in any way The sunrays are the ultimate source of life on the Earth We are dependent on the Sun for all our food and fuels If we find a suitable method to use a fraction of the solar energy reaching the Earth then it would be enough to fulfil our energy use of solar energy is not new However its use in houses and offices as well as for commercial industrial purposes is quite recent Complete solar house heating systems are successfully used in areas with a minimum amount of sunshine in winter A

The hot water can be used for cooking washing and heating the buildingsSolar energy is used in solar cookers solar distillation plants solar power plant energy can also be converted directly into electricity by solar cells A solar cell also called photo cell is made from silicon wafer When sunlight falls on a solar cell it converts the light directly into electrical energy Solar cells are used in calculators watches and toys Large numbers of solar cells are wired together to form solar panels Solar panels can provide power to telephone booths light houses and scientific research centres Solar panels are also used to power satellitesSeveral other methods to trap sunrays are under way If scientists could find an efficient and inexpensive method to use solar energy then the people would

water More recently wind power is used to turn wind turbines Figure 624 When many wind machines are grouped together on wind farms they can generate enough power to operate a power plant In the United States some wind farms generate more than 1300 MW of electricity a day In Europe many wind farms routinely generate hundred megawatts or more electricity a some parts of the world the Earth provides us hot water from geysers and hot springs There is hot molten part deep in the Earth called magma Water reaching close to the magma changes to steam due to the high temperature of magma This energy is called geothermal energyGeothermal well can be built by drilling deep near hot rocks at places where magma is not very deep Water is then pushed down into the well The rocks quickly heat the water and change it into steam It expands and moves up to the surface The steam can be piped directly into houses and offices for heating purposes or it can be used to generate is plant or animal wastes that can be burnt as fuel Other forms of biomass are garbage farm wastes sugarcane and other plants These wastes are used to run power plants Many industries that use forest products get half of their electricity by burning bark and other wood wastes Biomass can serve as another energy source but problems are there in its useWhen animal dung dead plants and dead animals decompose they give off a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide Electricity can be generated by burning methaneFigure 624 Wind turbinesFigure 625 A geothermal power stationFigure 626 A biomass plant using animal dung132Unit 6

electricity in houses offices schools business centres factories and in farms We have different ways of generating electricity Most of the electricity is obtained using fossil fuels such as oil gas

nuclear energy Pollution is the change in the quality of environment that can be harmful and unpleasant for living things A temperature rise in the environment that disturbs life is called thermal pollution Thermal pollution upsets the balance of life and endangers the survival of many speciesAir pollutants are unwanted and harmful Natural processes such as volcanic eruptions forest fires and dust storms add pollutant to the air These pollutant rarely build up to harmful levels On the other hand the burning of fuel and solid wastes in homes automobiles and factories releases harmful amount of air pollutantsAll power plants produce waste heat but fission plants produce the most The heat released into a lake a river or an ocean upsets the balance of life in them Unlike other power plants nuclear power plants do not produce carbon dioxide But they do produce dangerous radioactive wastesIn many countries governments have passed laws to control air pollution Some of these laws limit the amount of pollution that power plants factories and automobiles are allowed to give off To meet these conditions for automobiles new cars have catalytic converters These devices convert some polluting gases The use of lead free petrol has greatly reduced the amount of lead in the air Engineers are working to improve new kinds of car engines that use electricity or energy sources other than diesel and petrolMany individual communities have laws which protect their areas from pollution Individuals can help to control air pollution simply by reducing the use of cars and other machines that burn

energy converter to transform it into other forms of ON A 6 Work and Energy Physics IX6 We provide some form of energy to a machine This is necessary for the machine to work Human machine also needs energy to do a variety of work We take food to fulfil the energy needs of our bodyWe give some form of energy to machines as input to get useful work done by them as output For example electric motors may be used to pump water to blow air to wash clothes to drill holes etc For that depends how much output we obtain from it by giving certain input The ratio of useful output to input energy is very important to judge the working of a machine It is called the efficiency of a machine defined asEfficiency of a system is the ratio of required form of energy obtained from a system as output to the total energy given to it as inputAn ideal system is that which gives an output equal to the total energy used by it In other words its efficiency is 100  People have tried to design a working system that would be 100  efficient But practically such a system does not exist Every system meets energy losses due to friction that causes heat noise etc These are not the useful forms of energy and go waste This means we cannot utilize all the energy given to a working system The energy in the required form obtained from a working system is always less than the energy given to it as 65A cyclist

three states solid liquid and gas There are many properties associated with matter For example matter has weight and occupies space There are some other properties which are associated with one state of matter but not with other For example solids have shape of their own while liquids and gases do not Liquids on the other hand have definite volume while gases do not have Various materials differ in their hardness density solubility flow elasticity conductivity and many other qualities Kinetic molecular model helps in understanding the properties of matter in a simplified way71 OF kinetic molecular model of matter as shown in figure 72 has some important features These are• Matter is made up of particles called molecules• The molecules remain in continuous motion• Molecules attract each otherKinetic molecular model is used to explain the three states of matter  solid liquid and such as a stone metal spoon pencil etc have fixed shapes and volume Their molecules are held close together such as shown in figure 73 by strong forces of attraction However they vibrate about their mean positions but do not move from place to distances between the molecules of a liquid are more than in solids Thus attractive forcesFigure 71 Water exists in all the three statesFigure 72 Kinetic molecular model of the three states of matterFigure 73 Molecules are closely packed in solids Unit 7 Properties of Matter Physics 146between them are weaker Like solids molecules of a liquid also vibrate about their mean position but are not rigidly held with each other Due to the weaker attractive forces they can slide over one another Thus the liquids can flow The volume of a certain amount of liquid remains the same but because it can flow hence it attains the shape of a container to which it is such as air have no fixed shape or volume They can be filled in any container of any shape Their molecules have random motion and move with very high velocities In gases molecules are much farther apart than solids or liquids such as shown in figure 75 Thus gases are much lighter than solids and liquids They can be squeezed into smaller volumes The molecules of a gas are constantly striking the walls of a container Thus a gas exerts pressure on the walls of the  THE OF kinetic energy of gas molecules goes on increasing if a gas is heated continuously This causes the gas molecules to move faster and faster The collisions between atoms and molecules of the gas become so strong that they tear off the atoms Atoms lose their electrons and become positive ions This ionic state of matter is called plasma Plasma is also formed in gas discharge tubes when electric current passes through these tubesPlasma is called the fourth state of matter inwhich a gas occurs in its ionic state Positive ions and electrons get separated in the presence of electric or magnetic fields Plasma also exists in neon and fluorescent tubes when they glow Most of the matter that fills the universe is in plasma state In stars such as our Sun gases exist in their ionic state Plasma is highly conducting state of matter It allows electric current to pass through itFigure 74 Molecules are loosely packed in

7 Properties of Matter Physics 1477 Not necessary It depends upon the quantity of iron and wood you are comparing For example if we take equal volumes of iron and wood then we can easily declare that iron is heavier than wood In other words we can say that iron is heavier than woodTo know which substance is denser or which is lighter we generally compare the densities of various substances The density of a substance is the ratio of its mass to that of its volume ThusDensity of a substance is defined as its mass per unit volumeSI unit of density is kilogramme per cubic metre 3kgm  We can calculate the density of a material if we know its mass and its volume For example the mass of 5 litre of water is 5 kg Its density can be calculated by putting the values in equation 71Since 1 litre5

its the density of stone is 25 g cm 73 a pencil from its ends between the palms The palm pressing the tip feels much more pain than the palm pressing its blunt end We can push a drawing pin into a wooden board by pressing it by our thumb It is because the force we apply on the drawing pin is confined just at a very small area under its sharp tip A drawing pin with a blunt tip would be very difficult to push into the board due to the large area of its tip In these examples we find that the effectiveness of a small force is increased if the effective area of the force is reduced The area of the tip of pencil or that of the nail is very small and hence increases the effectiveness of the force The quantity that depends upon the force and increases with decrease in the area on which force is acting is called pressure Thus pressure is defined asThe force acting normally per unit area on the surface of a body is called pressureEarths atmosphere extends upward about a few hundred kilometres with continuously decreasing density Nearly half of its mass is between sea level and 10 km Up to 30 km from sea level contains about 99 of the mass of the atmosphere The air becomes thinner and thinner as we go upFigure 77 Smaller is the area larger will be the pressureFigure 78 A drawing pin with a sharp tip enters easily when pressed on a wooden boardAirpressureAtmosphericpressureUnit 7 Properties of Matter Physics 149Pressure is a scalar quantity In SI units the unit of 2pressure is Nm also called pascal Pa Thus21 Nm  1 Pa74 Earth is surrounded by a cover of air called atmosphere It extends to a few hundred kilometres above sea level Just as certain sea creatures live at the bottom of ocean we live at the bottom of a huge ocean of air Air is a mixture of gases The density of air in the atmosphere is not uniform It decreases continuously as we go upAtmospheric pressure acts in all directions Look at the picture in figure 79 Soap bubbles expand till the pressure of air in them is equal to the atmospheric pressureA balloon expands as we fill air into it The fact that atmosphere exerts pressure can be explained by a simple an empty tin can with a lid Open its cap and put some water in it Place it over flame Wait till water begins to boil and the steam expels the air out of the can Remove it from the flame Close the can firmly by its cap Now place the can under tap water The can will squeeze due to atmospheric pressureWhen the can is cooled by tap water the steam in it condenses As the steam changes into water it leaves an empty space behind it This lowers the pressure inside the can as compared to the atmospheric pressure outside the can This will cause the can to collapse from all directions This experiment shows that atmosphere exerts pressure in all directionsFigure 79 The air pressure inside the bubble is equal to the atmospheric pressureFigure 710 Air pressure inside the balloon is equal to the atmospheric pressureFigure 711 Crushing can  AirDust  DirtUnit 7 Properties of Matter Physics 150The fact can also be demonstrated by collapsing of an empty plastic bottle when air is sucked out of sea level the atmospheric pressure is about 2101300 Pa or 101300 Nm  The instruments that measure atmospheric pressure are called barometers One of the simple barometers is a mercury barometer It consists of a glass tube 1m long closed at one end After filling it with mercury it is inverted in a mercury trough Mercury in the tube descends and stops at a certain height The column of mercury held in the tube exerts pressure at its base At sea level the height of mercury column above the mercury in the trough is found to be about 76 cm Pressure exerted by 76 cm of mercury 2column is nearly 101300 Nm equal to atmospheric pressure It is common to express atmospheric pressure in terms of the height of mercury column As the atmospheric pressure at a place does not remains constant hence the height of mercury column also varies with atmospheric pressureMercury is 136 times denser than water Atmospheric pressure can hold vertical column of water about 136 times the height of mercury column at a place Thus at sea level vertical height of water column would be 076 m x 136  1034 m Thus a glass tube more than 10 m long is required to make a water IN atmospheric pressure decreases as we go up The atmospheric pressure on mountains is lower than at sea level At a height of about 30 km the atmospheric pressure becomes only 7 mm of mercury which is approximately 1000 Pa It would become zero at an altitude where there is no air Thus we can determine the altitude of a place by knowing the atmospheric pressure at that placeFigure 7The fan in a vacuum cleaner lowers air pressure in its bucket The atmospheric air rushes into it carrying dust and dirt with it through its intake port The dust and dirt particles are blocked by the filter while air escapes outAh PUnit 7 Properties of Matter Physics 151Atmospheric pressure may also indicate a change in the weather On a hot day air above the Earth becomes hot and expands This causes a fall of atmospheric pressure in that region On the other hand during cold chilly nights air above the Earth cools down This causes an increase in atmospheric pressureThe changes in atmospheric pressure at a certain place indicate the expected changes in the weather conditions of that place For example a gradual and average drop in atmospheric pressure means a low pressure in a neighbouring locality Minor but rapid fall in atmospheric pressure indicates a windy and showery condition in the nearby region A decrease in atmospheric pressure is accompanied by breeze and rain Whereas a sudden fall in atmospheric pressure often followed by a storm rain and typhoon to occur in few hours timeOn the other hand an increasing atmospheric pressure with a decline later on predicts an intense weather conditions A gradual large increase in the atmospheric pressure indicates a long spell of pleasant weather A rapid increase in atmospheric pressure means that it will soon be followed by a decrease in the atmospheric pressure indicating poor weather ahead75 IN exert pressure The pressure of a liquid acts in all directions If we take a pressure sensor a device that measures pressure inside a liquid then the pressure of the liquid varies with the depth of sensorConsider a surface of area A in a liquid at a depth h as shown by shaded region in figure 713 The length of the cylinder of liquid over this surface will be h The force acting on this surface will be the weight w of the liquid above this surfaceWhen air is sucked through straw with its other end dipped in a liquid the air pressure in the straw decreases This causes the atmospheric pressure to push the liquid up the strawFigure 713 Pressure of a liquid at a depth hPistonCylinder 7 Properties of Matter Physics 152Force acting on area Aas PressureLiquid pressure at depth hEquation 73 gives the pressure at a depth h in a liquid of density  It shows that its pressure in a liquid increases with external force applied on the surface of a liquid increases the liquid pressure at the surface of the liquid This increase in liquid pressure is transmitted equally in all directions and to the walls of the container in which it is filled This result is called Pascals law which is stated asPressure applied at any point of a liquid enclosed in a container is transmitted without loss to all other parts of the liquidIt can be demonstrated with the help of a glass vessel having holes all over its surface as shown in figure 714 Fill it with water Push the piston The water rushes out of the holes in the vessel with the same pressure The force applied on the piston exerts pressure on water This pressure is transmitted equally throughout the liquid in all directionsIn general this law holds good for fluids both for liquids as well as OF law finds numerous applications in our daily life such as automobiles hydraulic brake system hydraulic jack hydraulic press and other hydraulic machine such as shown in figure press is a machine which works on Pascals lawThe piston of the syringe is pulled out This lowers the pressure in the cylinder The liquid from the bottle enters into the piston through the needleFigure 714 Demonstrating Pascals lawFigure 715

object to be compressed is placed over the piston of large crosssectional area A The force F is applied on the 1piston of small crosssectional area a The pressure P produced by small piston is transmitted equally to the large piston and a force F acts on A which is much larger 2than F1Pressure on piston of small area a is given byApply Pascals law the pressure on large piston of area A will be the same as on small pistonComparing the above equations we getSince the ratio is greater than 1 hence theforce F that acts on the larger piston is greater than the 2force F acting on the smaller piston Hydraulic systems 1working in this way are known as force 72In a hydraulic press a force of 100 N is applied on 2the piston of a pump of crosssectional area 001 m  Find the force that

Pascal’s law we getForce acting on the baleThus hydraulic press will compress the bale with a force of 10000 IN 717 A hydraulic brake of a carThe braking systems of cars buses etc also work on Pascals law The hydraulic brakes as shown in figure 717 allow equal pressure to be transmitted throughout the liquid When brake pedal is pushed it exerts a force on the master cylinder which increases the liquid pressure in it The liquid pressure is transmitted equally through the liquid in the metal pipes to all the pistons of other cylinders Due to the increaseP1 h1h2h F2 AF1Unit 7 Properties of Matter Physics 155in liquid pressure the pistons in the cylinders move outward pressing the brake pads with the brake drums The force of friction between the brake pads and the brake drums stops the wheels76 air filled balloon immediately shoots up to the surface when released under water The same would happen if a piece of wood is released under water We might have noticed that a mug filled with water feels light under water but feels heavy as soon as we take it out of waterMore than two thousand years ago the Greek scientist Archimedes noticed that there is an upward force which acts on an object kept inside a liquid As a result an apparent loss of weight is observed in the object This upward force acting on the object is called the upthrust of the liquid Archimedes principle states thatWhen an object is totally or partially immersed in a liquid an upthrust acts on it equal to the weight of the liquid it displacesConsider a solid cylinder of crosssectional area A and height h immersed in a liquid as shown in figure 718 Let hand h be the depths of the top and bottom 1 2faces of the cylinder respectively from the surface of the liquidThenIf Pand P are the liquid pressures at depths h 1 2 1and h respectively and is its density then according to 2equation 73Let the force is exerted at the cylinder top by the liquid due to pressure P and the force F is exerted at the 1 2bottom of the cylinder by the liquid due to P2Figure 718 Upthrust on a body immersed in a liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid displacedWeight 7 Properties of Matter Physics 156F and F are acting on the opposite faces of the 1 2cylinder Therefore the net force F will be F  F in the 2 1direction of F  This net force F on the cylinder is called 2the upthrust of the liquidHere Ah is the volume V of the cylinder and is equal to the volume of the liquid displaced by the cylinder Therefore gV is the weight of the liquid displaced Equation 76 shows that an upthurst acts on the body immersed in a liquid and is equal to the weight of liquid displaced which is Archimedes 73A wooden cube of sides 10 cm each has been dipped completely in water Calcuclate the upthurst of water acting

weight in the bottom It is partially immersed in a fluid the density of which is to be measured One type of hydrometer is used to measure the concentration of acid in a battery It is called acid metera bUnit 7 Properties of Matter Physics OF AN principle is also helpful to determine the density of an object The ratio in the weights of a body with an equal volume of liquid is the same as in their densitiesLet Density of the object  DDensity of the liquid  Weight of the object  w1Weight of equal volume of liquid  w  w  w1 2Here w is the weight of the solid in liquid 2According to Archimedes principle w is less than its 2actual weight w by an amount w1Sinceor Thus finding the weight of the solid in air w and 1its weight in water w  we can calculate the density of the 2solid by using equation 77 as illustrated in the following 74The weight of a metal spoon in air is 048 N its weight in water is 042 N Find its of the spoon  048 NWeight of spoon in water w  0Using equation 78 3Thus density of the material of the spoon is 8000 kgm Figure 719 a weighing solid in air b weighing solid in water and measuring water displaced by the solid2Unit 7 Properties of Matter Physics 15877 OF object sinks if its weight is greater than the upthrust acting on it An object floats if its weight is equal or less than the upthrust When an object floats in a fluid the upthrust acting on it is equal to the weight of the object In case of floating object the object may be partially immersed The upthrust is always equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object This is the principle of floatation It states thatA floating object displaces a fluid having weight equal to the weight of the objectArchimedes principle is applicable on liquids as well as gases We find numerous applications of this principle in our daily 75An empty meteorological balloon weighs 80 N It 3is filled with 10 cubic metres of hydrogen Th e density of hydrogen is 009 kgm and the 3density of air is

contents the total weight of the balloon should not exceed FUnit 7 Properties of Matter Physics 159Thus the maximum weight of 41 N can be lifted by the balloon in addition to its own AND wooden block floats on water It is because the weight of an equal volume of water is greater than the weight of the block According to the principle of floatation a body floats if it displaces water equal to the weight of the body when it is partially or completely immersed in waterShips and boats are designed on the same principle of floatation They carry passengers and goods over water It would sink in water if its weight including the weight of its passengers and goods becomes greater than the upthrust of waterA submarine can travel over as well as under water It also works on the principle of floatation It floats over water when the weight of water equal to its volume is greater than its weight Under this condition it is similar to a ship and remains partially above water level It has a system of tanks which can be filled with and emptied from seawater When these tanks are filled with seawater the weight of the submarine increases As soon as its weight becomes greater than the

it Similarly the pointer of a spring balance is lowered when a body is suspended from it It is because the length of the spring inside the balance increases depending upon the weight of the suspended body Look at the pictures in figure 722 What happens to the objects due to the forces acting on them The applied force that changes shape length or volume of a substance is called deforming force In most of the cases the body returns to its original size and shape as soon as the deforming force is removedThe property of a body to restore its original size and shape as the deforming force ceases to act is called is related to the force producing deformation It is defined asThe force acting on unit area at the surface of a body is called stressFigure 722 a A spring is stretched by a force b A

of such a change caused by the stress with the original length volume or shape is called as strain If stress produces a change in the length of an object then the strain is called tensile strainStrain has no units as it is simply a ratio between two similar quantities79 has been observed that deformation in length volume or shape of a body depends upon the stress acting on the body Hookes law states thatThe strain produced in a body by the stress applied to it is directly proportional to the stress within the elastic limit of the bodyHookes law is applicable to all kinds of deformation and all types of matter ie solids liquids or gases within certain limit This limit tells the maximum stress that can be safely applied on a body without causing permanent deformation in its length volume or shape In other words it is a limit within which a body recovers its original length volume or shape after the deforming force is removed When a stress crosses this limit called the elastic limit a body is permanently deformed and is unable to restore its original state after the stress is removedFigure 723 Extension in the spring depends upon the loadFigure 724 Graph between force and

water is 31000 kgm Pressure is the normal force acting 2per unit area Its SI unit is Nm or pascal PaAtmospheric pressure acts in all directionsThe instruments that measure atmospheric pressure are called barometersThe atmospheric pressure decreases as we go up Thus knowing the atmospheric pressure of a place we can determine its altitudeThe changes in atmospheric pressure at a certain place indicate the expected changes in the weather conditions of that placeLiquids also exert pressure given by P  g hLiquids transmit pressure equally in all directions This is called Pascals lawWhen a body is immersed wholly or partially in a liquid it loses its weight equal to the weight of the liquid displaced This is known as Archimedes principleFor an object to float its weight must be equal or less than the upthrust of the liquid acting on itThe property of matter by virtue of which matter resists any force which tries to change its length shape or volume is called elasticityStress is the

have basic understanding about heat Heat is an important concept in Physics People have been trying to explain the nature of heat throughout the history of mankind A quantitative study of thermal phenomena requires a careful definition of such important terms as heat temperature and internal energy In this unit we shall discuss various concepts related to heat temperature measurements of temperature and various thermal phenomenaMajor Concepts81 Temperature and heat82 Thermometer83 Specific heat capacity84 Latent heat of fusion85 Latent heat of vaporization86 Evaporation87 Thermal expansionFigure 81 Heat is needed for cookingPhysics IX 16881 AND we touch a body  we feel it hot or cold The temperature of a body tells us how hot or cold a body is ThusTemperature of a body is the degree of hotness or coldness of the bodyA candle flame is hot and is said to be at high temperature  Ice on the other hand is cold and is said to be at low temperature  Our sense of touch is a simple way to know how much hot or cold a body is However  this temperature sense is some what approximation and unreliable  Moreover  it is not always safe to touch a hot body  What we need is a reliable and practicable method to determine the relative hotness or coldness of bodies To understand the concept of temperature  it is useful to understand the terms thermal contact and thermal equilibrium  To store ice in summer people wrap it with cloth or keep it in wooden box or in thermos flask In this way they avoid the thermal contact of ice with its hot surroundings otherwise ice will soon melt away  Similarly  when you place a cup of hot tea or water in a room it cools down gradually It stops cooling as it reaches the room temperature  Thus temperature determines the direction of flow of heat Heat flows from a hot body to a cold body until thermal equilibrium is reached Take two bodies having different temperatures  Bring them in contact with each other The temperature of the hot body falls It looses energy  This energy enters the cold body at lower temperature  Cold body gains energy and its temperature rises The transfer of energy continues till both the bodies have the same temperature  The form of energy that is transferred from a hot body to a cold body is called heat ThusHeat is the energy that is transferred from one body to the other in thermal contact with each other as a result of the difference of temperature between themDO YOU crocus flower is anatural thermometer It opens when the temperature is precisely 23°C and closes when the temperature dropsFigure 82 A strip thermometerUnit 8 Thermal Properties of Matter Physics IX 169Heat is therefore called as the energy in transit Once heat enters a body it becomes its internal energy and no longer exists as heat energyThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy associated with the atoms molecules and particles of a body is called its internal energyInternal energy of a body depends on many factors such as the mass of the body kinetic and potential energies of molecules etc Kinetic energy of an atom or molecule is due to its motion which depends upon the temperature Potential energy of atoms or molecules is the stored energy due to intermolecular forces82 device that is used to measure the temperature of a body is called thermometer Some substances have property that changes with temperature Substances that show a change with temperature can be used as a thermometric material For example some substances expand on heating some change their colours some change their electric resistance etc Nearly all the substances expand on heating Liquids also expand on heating and are suitable as thermometric materials Common thermometers are generally made using some suitable liquid as thermometric material A thermometric liquid should have the following properties It should be visibleIt should have uniform thermal expansionIt should have a low freezing pointIt should have a high boiling pointIt should not wet glassIt should be a good conductor of heatIt should have a small specific heat capacityFigure 83 A thermometer shows body temperature Mini Exercise1a steel  b copper c water  d mercury2 Every thermometer makes use of some property of a material that varies with temperature  Name the property used ina strip thermometersb mercury thermometersUnit 8 Thermal Properties of Matter Physics IX 170BulbMercury Mercury thread Glass tube Temperature liquidinglass thermometer has a bulb with a long capillary tube of uniform and fine bore such as shown in figure 84 A suitable liquid is filled in the bulb When the bulb contacts a hot object the liquid in it expands and rises in the tube The glass stem of a thermometer is thick and acts as a cylindrical lens This makes it easy to see the liquid level in the glass tubeMercury freezes at39 °C and boils at 357 °C It has all the thermometric properties listed above Thus mercury is one of the most suitable thermometric material Mercuryinglass thermometers are widely used in laboratories clinics and houses to measure temperatures in the range from 10 °C to 150 AND thermometer has a scale on its stem This scale has two fixed points The lower fixed point is marked to show the position of liquid in the thermometer when it is placed in ice Similarly upper fixed point is marked to show the position of liquid in the thermometer when it is placed in steam at standard pressure above boiling OF scale is marked on the thermometer The temperature of the body in contact with the thermometer can be read on that scale Three scales of temperature are in common use These areUnit 8 Thermal Properties of Matter Physics IX 171Celsius Scale Fahrenheit Scale Kelvin Scale i Celsius scale or centigrade scaleii Fahrenheit scaleiii Kelvin scaleOn Celsius scale the interval between lower and upper fixed points is divided into 100 equal parts as shown in figure 85a The lower fixed point is marked as 0 °C and the upper fixed point is marked as 100 °COn Fahrenheit scale the interval between lower and upper fixed points is divided into 180 equal parts Its lower fixed point is marked as 32 °F and upper fixed point is marked as 212 °F Figure 85bIn SI units the unit of temperature is kelvin K and its scale is called Kelvin scale of temperature as shown in figure 85 c The interval between the lower and upper fixed points is divided into 100 equal parts Thus a change in 1°C is equal to a change of 1K The lower fixed point on this scale corresponds to 273 K and the upper fixed point is referred as 373 K The zero on this scale is called the absolute zero and is equal to  273 OF ONE Celsius to Kelvin ScaleThe temperature T on Kelvin scale can be obtained by adding 273 in the temperature C on Celsius scale 85 Various scales oftemperatureA clinical thermometer is used to measure the temperature of human body It has a narrow range from 35 °C to 42 °C It has a constriction that prevents the mercury to return Thus its reading does not change until TO temperature on Celsius scale can be found by subtracting 273 from the temperature in Kelvin Scale 82Change 300K on Kelvin scale into Celsius scale of TO 100 divisions on Celsius scale are equal to 180 divisions on Fahrenheit scale Therefore each division on Celsius scale is equal to 18 divisions on Fahrenheit scale Moreover 0°C corresponds to 32°FHere F is the temperature on Fahrenheit scale and C is the temperature on Celsius 83Convert 50°C on Celsius scale into Fahrenheit temperature 50 °C on Celsius scale is 122 °F on Fahrenheit scaleSinceorSinceorUnit 8 Thermal Properties of Matter Physics IX TO equation 83 we can find the temperature on Celsius scale from Fahrenheit 84Convert 100 °F into the temperature on  3 S P E C I F I C H E AT C A PA C I T Y Generally when a body is heated its temperature increases Increase in the temperature of a body is found to be proportional to the amount of heat absorbed by it It has also been observed that the quantity of heat Q required to raise the temperature T of a body is proportional to the mass m of the body ThusHere Q is the amount of heat absorbed by the body and c is the constant of proportionality called the specific heat capacity or simply specific heatThe specific heat of a substance is defined asSpecific heat of a substance is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg mass of that substance through 1KMathematicallyIn SI units mass m is measured in kilogramme kg heat Q is measured in joule J and temperature increase T is taken in kelvin K Hence SI unit ofSinceorororo oThus 100 F is equal to 378 CorTable 81 Specific heat ofsome common substancesUnit 8 Thermal Properties of Matter Physics IX 174Fan to coolradiatorWater circulatesto cool

are given in Table OF OF 1Specific heat of water is 4200 Jkg K and that of 1 1dry soil is about 810 Jkg K  As a result the temperature of soil would increase five times more than the same mass of water by the same amount of heat Thus the temperature of land rises and falls more rapidly than that of the sea Hence the temperature variations from summer to winter are much smaller at places near the sea than land far away from the seaWater has a large specific heat capacity For this reason it is very useful in storing and carrying thermal energy due to its high specific heat capacity The cooling system of automobiles uses water to carry away unwanted thermal energy In an automobile large amount of heat is produced by its engine due to which its temperature goes on increasing The engine would cease unless it is not cooled down Water circulating around the engine as shown by arrows in figure 86 maintains its temperature Water absorbs unwanted thermal energy of the engine and dissipates heat through its radiatorIn central heating systems such as shown in figure 87 hot water is used to carry thermal energy through pipes from boiler to radiators These radiators are fixed

heating systemUnit 8 Thermal Properties of Matter Physics IX 175Specific heat of waterInitial temperatureFinal temperatureTemperature IncreaseSinceorThus required amount of heat is 840 000 J or 840 much heat a body can absorb depends on many factors Here we define a quantity called heat capacity of a body asHeat capacity of a body is the quantity of thermal energy absorbed by it for one kelvin 1 K increase in its temperatureThus if the temperature of a body increases through T on adding Q amount of heat then its heatcapacity will be Putting the value of Q we getEquation 86 shows that heat capacity of a body is equal to the product of its mass of the body and its specific heat capacity For example heat capacity of 5 kg 1 1 1of water is 5 kg x 4200 Jkg K  21000 JK  That is 5 kg of water needs 21000 joules of heat for every 1 K rise in its temperature Thus larger is the quantity of a substance larger will be its heat capacityThe presence of large water reservoirs such as lakes and seas keep the climates of nearby land moderate due to the large heat capacity of these reservoirsUnit 8 Thermal Properties of Matter Physics IX 176Thermal energy is taken in Thermal energy is taken

temperature at which a solid starts melting is called its fusion point or melting point When the process is reversed ie when a liquid is cooled it changes into solid state The temperature at which a substance changes from liquid to solid state is called its freezing point Different substances have different melting points However the freezing point of a substance is the same as its melting pointHeat energy required to change unit mass of a substance from solid to liquid state at its melting point without change in its temperature is called its latent heat of fusionIt is denoted by HfoIce changes at 0 C into water Latent heat of 5 1 5fusion of ice is 336 x10 Jkg  That is 336x10 joule heat is required to melt 1 kg of ice into water at 0 °C 81Take a beaker and place it over a

boiling point is used up in changing its state from liquid to gas without any increase in its temperature ThusThe quantity of heat that changes unit mass of a liquid completely into gas at its boiling point without any change in its temperature is called its latent heat of vaporizationIt is denoted by HvWhen water is heated it boils at 100°C under standard pressure Its temperature remains 100°C

will disappear after sometime It is because the molecules of water are in constant motion and possess kinetic energy Fast moving molecules escape out from the surface of water and goes into the atmosphere This is called evaporation ThusEvaporation is the changing of a liquid into vapours gaseous state from the surface of the liquid without heating itUnlike boiling evaporation takes place at all temperatures but only from the surface of a liquid The process of boiling takes place at a certain fixed temperature which is the boiling point of that liquid At boiling point a liquid is changing into vapours not only from the surface but also within the liquid These vapours come out of the boiling liquid as bubbles which breakdown on reaching the surfaceEvaporation plays an important role in our daily life Wet clothes dry up rapidly when spread Evaporation causes cooling During evaporation fast moving molecules escape out from the surface of the liquid Molecules that have lower kinetic energies are left behind This lowers the average kinetic energy of the liquid molecules and the temperature of theSincePutting the values we getfrom eq88orPutting the values of and from the graph we

Properties of Matter Physics IX Radiator fins Condenser Since temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of its molecules Evaporation of perspiration helps to cool our bodiesEvaporation takes place at all temperature from the surface of a liquid The rate of evaporation is affected by various factors At higher temperature more molecules of a liquid are moving with high velocities Thus more molecules escape from its surface Thus evaporation is faster at high temperature than at low temperature Larger is the surface area of a liquid greater number of molecules has the chance to escape from its blowing over the surface of a liquid sweeps away the liquid molecules that have just escaped out This increases the chance for more liquid molecules to escape out Liquids differ in the rate at which they evaporate Spread a few drops of ether or spirit on your palm88 of the substances solids liquids and gases expand on heating and contract on cooling Their thermal expansions and contractions are usually small and are not noticeable However these expansions and contractions are important in our daily lifeThe kinetic energy of the molecules of an object depends on its temperature The molecules of a solid vibrate with larger amplitude at high temperature IN is produced in refrigerators by evaporation of a liquified gas This produces cooling effect Freon a CFC was used as a refrigerant gas But its use has been forbidden when it was known that CFC is the cause of ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere which results increase in amount of UV rays

and contraction with temperature  For example  railway tracks buckled on a hot summer day due to expansion if gaps are not left between sections Bridges made of steel girders also expand during the day and contract during night  They will bend if their ends are fixed To allow thermal expansion  one end is fixed while the other end of the girder rests on rollers in the gap left for expansion  Overhead transmission lines are also given a certain amount of sag so that they can contract in winter without snapping OF expansion is used in our daily life In thermometers  thermal expansion is used in temperature measurements  To open the cap of a bottle that is tight enough  immerse it in hot water for a minute or so Metal cap expands and becomes loose  It would now be easy to turn it to open To join steel plates tightly together  red hot rivets are forced through holes in the plates as shown in figure 818 a The end of hot rivet is then hammered  On cooling  the rivets contract and bring the plates tightly gripped Iron rims are fixed on wooden wheels of carts Iron rims are heated  Thermal expansion allows them to slip over the wooden wheel  Water is poured on it to cool The rim contracts and becomes tight over the wheel bimetal strip consists of two thin strips of different metals such as brass and iron joined together as shown in figure 819a On heating the strip brassUnit 8

thermostat switch such as shown in figure 820 is used to control the temperature of heater coil in an electric OF molecules of liquids are free to move in all directions within the liquid On heating a liquid the average amplitude of vibration of its molecules increases The molecules push each other and need more space to occupy This accounts for the expansion of the liquid when heated The thermal expansion in liquids is greater than solids due to the weak forces between their molecules Therefore the coefficient of volume expansion of liquids is greater than solidsLiquids have no definite shape of their own A liquid always attains shape of the container in which it is poured Therefore when a liquid is heated both liquid and the container undergo a change in their volume Thus there are two types of thermal volume expansion for liquid• Apparent volume expansion• Real volume expansionFigure 820 Bimetal thermostat breaks the electrical circuit at preset temperatureWater on cooling below 4°C begins to expand until it reaches 0°C On further cooling its volume increases suddenly as it changes into ice at 0°C When ice is cooled below 0°C it contracts ie its volume decreases like solids This unusual expansion of water is called the anomalous expansion of waterUnit 8 Thermal Properties of Matter Physics IX 821 Real and apparent expansion of a longnecked flask Fill it with some coloured liquid upto the mark A on its neck as shown in figure 821 Now start heating the flask from bottom The liquid level first falls to B and then rises to CThe heat first reaches the flask which expands and its volume increases As a result liquid descends in the flask and its level falls to B After sometime the liquid begins to rise above B on getting hot At certain temperature it reaches at C The rise in level from A to C is due to the apparent expansion in the volume of the liquid Actual expansion of the liquid is greater than that due to the expansion because of the expansion of the glass flask Thus real expansion of the liquid is equal to the volume difference between A and C in addition to the volume expansion of the flask HenceThe expansion of the volume of a liquid taking into consideration the expansion of the container also is called the real volume expansion of the liquid The real rate of volume expansion of a liquid is defined as the ractual change in the unit volume of a liquid for 1K  or 1°C  rise in its temperature The real rate of volume expansion is always greater than the apparent rate of volume rexpansion by an amount equal to the rate of volume aexpansion of the container  ThusgIt should be noted that different liquids have different coefficients of volume expansionReal expansionof the liquidApparent expansion ofthe liquidExpansion ofthe

form of energy and this energy is called heat as long as it is in the process of transfer from one body to another body When a body is heated the kinetic energy of its molecules increases the average

centigrade 1°C or one kelvin 1KThe heat required by unit mass of a substance at its melting point to change it from solid state to liquid state is called the latent heat of fusionThe quantity of heat required by the unit mass of a liquid at a certain constant temperature to change its state completely from liquid into gas is called the latent heat of vaporizationIt has been observed that solids expand on heating and their expansion is nearly uniform over a wide range of temperature MathematicallyThe thermal coefficient of linear expansion of a substance is defined as the fractional increase in its length per kelvin rise in temperatureThe volume of a solid changes with the change in temperature and is called as volume or cubical expansionThe thermal coefficient of volume expansion is

various ways of heat transferMajor Concepts91 The three process of heat transfer92 Conduction93 Convection94 Radiation95 Consequences and everyday applications of heat transferPhysics Radiation Hot ColdHeat energy flowHot ColdabFigure 92 In solids heat is transferred from one part to other parts from atoms to atoms or molecules to molecules due to collisions91 OF 91 Three ways of heat transferRecall what happens when two bodies at different temperature are in thermal contact with each other Thermal energy from a hot body flows to a cold body in the form of heat This is called as transfer of heat Transfer of heat is a natural process It continues all the time as long as the bodies in thermal contact are at different temperature There are three ways by which transfer of heat takes place These are conduction convection radiation of objects around us getting heat or giving out heat92 handle of metal spoon held in hot water soon gets warm But in case of a wooden spoon the handle does not get warm Both the materials behave differently regarding the transfer of heat Both metals and nonmetals conduct heat Metal are generally better conductors than nonmetalsIn solids atoms and molecules are packed close together as shown in figure 92 They continue to vibrate about their mean position The atoms or moleculesUnit 9 Transfer of Heat Physics IX195free electron positive ionHot Acrosssectional areaT2Lowtemperaturepresent at that end begin to vibrate more rapidly They also collide with their neighbouring atoms or molecules In doing so they pass some of their energy to neighbouring atoms or molecules during collisions with them with the increase in their vibrations These atoms or molecules in turn pass on a part of the energy to their neighbouring particles In this way some heat reaches the other parts of the solids This is a slow process and very small transfer of heat takes place from hot to cold parts in solids Metals have free electrons as shown in figure 93 These free electrons move with very high velocities within the metal objects They carry energy at a very fast rate from hot to cold parts of the object as they move Thus heat reaches the cold parts of the metal objects from its hot part much more quickly than nonmetalsThe mode of transfer of heat by vibrating atoms and free electrons in solids from hot to cold parts of a body is called conduction of heatAll metals are good conductors of heat The substances through which heat does not conduct easily are called bad conductors or insulators Wood cork cotton wool glass rubber etc are bad conductors or of heat occurs at different rates in different materials In metals heat flows rapidly as compared to insulators such as wood or rubber Consider a solid block as shown in figure 94 One of its two opposite faces each of crosssectional area A is heated to a temperature T Heat Q flows along its length L to 1opposite face at temperature T in t seconds2 The amount of heat that flows in unit time is called the rate of flow of heatThus Rate of flow of heat   91It is observed that the rate at which heat flows through a solid object depends upon various factorsFigure 93 Conduction of heat in metals Styrofoam is a bad conductor of heat It does not allow heat to leave or enter the box easilyFigure 94 Rate at which heat conducts through different solids depends upon various factorsUnit 9 Transfer of Heat Physics OF THE crosssectional area A of a solid contains larger number of molecules and free electrons on each layer parallel to its crosssectional area and hence greater will be the rate of flow of heat through the solid ThusRate of flow of OF THE is the length between the hot and cold ends of the solid more time it will take to conduct heat to the colder end and smaller will be the rate of flow of heat ThusRate of flow of is the temperature difference T  T1 2 between hot and cold faces of the solid greater will be the rate of flow of heat ThusRate of flow of heatCombining the above factors we getHere k is the proportionality constant called thermal conductivity of the solid Its value depends on the nature of the substance and is different for different materials From equation 92 we find k asThus thermal conductivity of a substance can be defined asThe rate of flow of heat across the opposite faces of a metre cube of a substance maintained at a temperature difference of one kelvin is called the thermal conductivity of that substanceThermal conductivities of some substances are given in the tableThermal conductivities of some common substancesUnit 9 Transfer of Heat Physics IX197Rate of flow of heatUSE OF AND houses  good thermal insulation means lower consumption of fuel For this following measures may be taken to save energy Hot water tanks are insulated by plastic or foam lagging Wall cavities are filled with plastic foam or woolCeiling of rooms is covered by insulating materials false ceiling Double glazed window panes are used These window panes have air between glass sheets that provides good insulation Good conductors are used when quick transfer of heat is required through a body Thus cookers  cooking plate boiler  radiators and condensers of refrigerators  etc are made of metals such as aluminum or copper  Similarly  metal boxes are used for making ice ice cream etcInsulators or bad conductors are used in home utensils such as handles of sauce pans hot plates spoons  etc They are made up of wood or plastic Air is one of the bad conductors or best insulator  That is why cavity walls ie two walls separated by an air space and double glazed windows keep the houses warm in winter and cool in summer Materials which trap air ie wool  felt fur feathers polystyrenes  fibre glass are also bad conductors  Some of these materials are used for laggings to insulate water pipes  hot water cylinders  ovens refrigerators  walls and roofs of houses  Woollen cloth is used to make warm winter clothes 91The exterior brick wall of a house of thickness 225 cm has an area 20 m The temperature inside the house is 15°C and outside is 35°C Find the rate at which thermal energy will be conducted through the wall the 1 1value

melting iceSaucepans are made of metal for quick heat transferFigure 95 Soft insulation board between external brick wall of a houseUnit 9 Transfer of Heat Physics IX198Using equation 92 rate of conduction of thermal energy is1 960 watt or 960 JsThus the rate of flow of thermal energy across the wall will be 960 joules per second93 and gases are poor conductors of heat However heat is transferred through fluids liquids or gases easily by another method called convectionWhy a balloon inflated with hot air as shown in figure 9 A liquid or a gas becomes lighter less dense as it expands on heating Hot liquid or gas rises up above the heated area The cooler liquid or gas from the surroundings fills the place which in turns is heated up In this way all the fluid is heated up Therefore transfer of heat through fluids takes place by the actual movement of heated molecules from hot to cold parts of the fluidTransfer of heat by actual movement of molecules from hot place to a cold place is known as 91Take a beaker and fill twothird of it with water Heat the beaker by keeping a burner below it Drop two or three crystals of potassium permanganate in the waterFeathers give

figure 911 looks like a small aeroplane without engine Glider pilots use upward movement of hot air currents due to convection of heat These rising currents of hot air are called thermals Gliders ride over these thermals The upward movement of air currents in thermals help them to stay in air for a long periodThe birds stretch out their wings and circle in these thermals The upward movement of air helps birds to climb up with it Eagles hawks and vultures are expert thermal climbers After getting a free lift birds are able to fly for hours without flapping their wings They glide from one thermal to another and thus travel through large distances and hardly need to flap their wings94 Sun is the major source of heat energy It reaches us neither by conduction nor by convection because the space between the Sun and the Earths atmosphere is empty There is a third mode called radiation by which heat travels from one place to another It is through radiation that heat reaches us from the SunRadiation is the mode of transfer of heat from one place to another in the form of waves called electromagnetic waves Figure 914 shows a fireplace such as used for room heating Heat does not reach us by conduction through air from a fireplace because air is a poor conductor of heat Heat does not reach us byUnit 9 Transfer of Heat Physics IX201Radiation detectorDull blackShiningsurface GalvanometerHot water insideconvection because the air getting heat from the fireplace does not move in all directions Hot air moves upward from the fireplace Heat from the fireplace reaches us directly by a different process in the form of waves called radiation A sheet of paper or cardboard kept in the path of radiations stop these waves to reach usRadiations are emitted by all bodiesAll the objects lying inside a room including the walls roof and floor of the room are radiating heat However they are also absorbing heat at the same time When temperature of an object is higher than its surroundings then it is radiating more heat than it is absorbing As a result its temperature goes on decreasing till it becomes equal to its surroundings At this stage the body is giving out the amount of heat equal to the amount of heat it is absorbingWhen temperature of an object is lower than its surroundings then it is radiating less heat than it is absorbing As a result its temperature goes on increasing till it becomes equal to its surroundings The rate at which various surfaces emit heat depends upon the nature of the surface Various surfaces can be compared using Leslies cubeEmission and Absorption of RadiationA Leslie cube is a metal box having faces of different nature as shown in figure 915 The four faces of Leslies cube may be as follows A shining silvered surface A dull black surface A white surface A coloured surfaceFigure 914 Heat from the fireplace reaches us by radiationFigure 915 Radiations from Leslies cubeUnit 9 Transfer of Heat Physics water is filled in the Leslies cube and is placed with one of its face towards a radiation detector It is found that black dull surface is a good emitter of heatThe rate at which various surfaces absorb heat also depends upon the nature of those surfaces For example take two surfaces one is dull black and the other is a silver polished surface as shown in figure 916 with a candle at the middle of the surface It is found thatA dull black surface is a good absorber of heat as its temperature rises rapidlyA polished surface is poor absorber of heat as its temperature rises very slowly The observations made from the set up shown in figure 916 are shown in the table given belowIt is also found that the transfer of heat by radiation is also affected by the surface area of the body emitting or absorbing heat Larger is the area greater will be the transfer of heat It is due to this reason that large numbers of slots are made in radiators to increase their surface areaLight from the Sun contains thermal radiations infrared of long wavelengths as well as light and ultraviolet radiations of short wavelengths Glass and transparent polythene sheets allow radiations of short wavelength to pass through easily but not long wavelengths of thermal radiations Thus a greenhouse becomes a heat trap Radiations from the Sun pass easily through glass and warms up the objects in a greenhouse These objects and plants such asFigure 916 A comparison of absorption of radiationUnit 9 Transfer of Heat Physics IX203The Greenhouse EffectSome energy is reflectedback out to spaceEarth’s surface isheated

of much longer wavelengths Glass and transparent polythene sheetsFigure 917 A greenhouse do not allow them to escape out easily and are reflected back in the greenhouse This maintains the inside temperature of the greenhouse Greenhouse effect promises better growth of some plantsCarbon dioxide and water also behave in a similar way to radiations as glass or polythene Earths atmosphere contains carbon dioxide and water vapours It causes greenhouse effect as shown in figure 918 and thus maintains the temperature of theFigure 918 Greenhouse effect in global warmingUnit 9 Transfer of Heat Physics IX204Cork stopperDouble walledglass vesselSilvered surfaces VacuumCork a thermos flask most of the heat is prevented to enter or leave the flask This is done by suitable measures to reduce the transfer of heat due to conduction convection and radiation Thus anything kept in it maintains its temperature for a long timeEarth During the recent years the percentage of carbon dioxide has been increased considerably This has caused an increase in the average temperature of the Earth by trapping more heat due to greenhouse effect This phenomenon is known as global warming This has serious implications for the global climate95 OF objects absorb different amounts of heat radiations falling upon them reflecting the remaining part The amount of heat absorbed by a body depends upon the colour and nature of its surface A black and rough surface absorbs more heat than a white or polished surface Since good absorbers are also good radiators of heat Thus a black coloured body gets hot quickly absorbing heat reaching it during a sunny day and also cools down quickly by giving out its heat to its surroundings The bottoms of cooking pots are made black to increase the absorption of heat from fireLike light rays heat radiations also obey laws of reflection The amount of heat reflected from an object depends upon its colour and nature of the surface White surfaces reflect more than coloured or black surfaces Similarly polished surfaces are good reflectors than rough surfaces and reflection of heat radiations is greater from polished surfaces Hence we wear white or light coloured clothes in summer which reflect most of the heat radiation reaching us during the hot day We polish the interior of the cooking and hot pots for reflecting back most of the heat radiation within flows from a body at higher temperature to a body at lower temperatureThere are three ways of heat transfer These are conduction convection and radiationUnit 9 Transfer of Heat Physics IX205Birds are able to fly for hours without flapping their wings due to the upward movement of air currentsThe term radiation means the continual emission of energy from the surface of a body in the form of electromagnetic wavesRadiations are emitted by all bodies The rate at which radiations are emitted depends on various factors such as colour and texture of the surface temperature and surface areaA dull black surface is a good absorber of heat as its temperature rises rapidlyA polished surface is poor absorber of heat as its temperature rises very slowlyRadiations from the Sun pass easily through glasspolythene and warms up the materials inside a greenhouse The radiations given out by them are of much longer wavelengths Glasspolythene does not allow them to escape out and thus maintains the i n s i d e t e m p e r a t u r e o f t h e greenhouseEarths atmosphere contains carbon dioxide and water vapours It causes greenhouse effect and thus retains the temperature of the EarthThe bottoms of cooking pots are made black to increase the absorption of heat from fire White surfaces reflect more heat than coloured or black surfaces Similarly polished surfaces are good reflectors than rough surfaces and reflection of heat radiations isThe mode of transfer of heat by vibrating atoms and free electrons in solids from hotter to colder part of a body is called conduction of heatThe amount of heat that flows in unit time is called the rate of flow of heatThe rate at which heat flows through solids depends on the crosssectional area of the solid length between hot and cold ends temperature difference between hot and cold ends and nature of the materialThe rate of flow of heat across the opposite faces of a metre cube maintained at a difference of 1 K is called the thermal conductivity of the material of the cubeGood conductors are used for quick transfer of heat Thus cookers cooking plate boiler radiators and condensers of refrigerators etc are made of metalsWater is a poor conductor of heatMaterials which trap air are also bad conductors such as wool felt fur feathers polystyrenes and fibre glassTransfer of heat by actual movement of
